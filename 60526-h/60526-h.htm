<p>It was Monday, just five days before Christmas.
The little pink express card arrived in
the noon mail. The girls knew there must be
some deviation from the usual daily mail routine,
when the mailman lingered at the white post.</p>

<p>Jean ran down the drive and he greeted her
cheerily.</p>

<p>“Something for you folks at the express office,
I reckon. If it’s anything hefty you’d better go
down and get it today. Looks like we’d have a
flurry of snow before nightfall.”</p>

<p>He waited while Jean glanced at the card.</p>

<p>“Know what it is?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t believe I do,” she answered,
regretfully. “Maybe they’re books for Father.”</p>

<p>“Like enough,” responded Mr. Ricketts, musingly.
“I didn’t know. I always feel a little
mite interested, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” laughed Jean, as he gathered
up his reins and jogged off down the bridge road.
She hurried back to the house, her head sideways
to the wind. The hall door banged as Kit let
her in, her hands floury from baking.</p>

<p>“Why on earth do you stand talking all day
to that old gossip? Is there any mail from the
west?”</p>

<p>“He only wanted to know about an express
bundle; whether it was hefty or light, and where
it came from and if we expected it,” Jean replied,
piling the mail on the dining-room table. “There
is no mail from Saskatoon, sister fair.”</p>

<p>“Well, I only wanted to hear from Honey.
He promised me a silver fox skin for Christmas
if he could find one.”</p>

<p>Kit’s face was perfectly serious. Honey had
asked her before he left Gilead Center just what
she would like best, and, truthful as always, Kit
had told him a silver fox skin. The other girls
had nicknamed it “The Quest of the Silver Fox,”
and called Honey a new Jason, but Kit still held
firmly to the idea that if there was any such
animal floating around, Honey would get it for
her.</p>

<p>Jean was engrossed in a five-page letter from
one of the girl students at the Academy back in
New York where she had studied the previous
winter. The sunlight poured through the big
semicircular bay window at the south end of the
dining-room. Here Doris and Helen maintained
the plant stand, a sort of half-moon
pyramid, home-made, with rows of potted ferns,
geraniums, and begonias on its steps. Helen
had fashioned some window boxes too, covered
with birchbark and lined with moss, trying to
coax some adder’s tongue and trailing ground
myrtle, with even some wild miniature pines, like
Japanese dwarfs, to stay green.</p>

<p>“It has turned bleak and barren out of doors
so suddenly,” said Helen. “One day it was all
beautiful yellow and russet and even old rose, but
the next, after that heavy frost, it was all dead.
I’m glad pines don’t mind frost and cold.”</p>

<p>“Pines are the most optimistic, dearest trees
of all,” Kit agreed, opening up an early spring
catalogue. “If it wasn’t for the pines and these
catalogues to encourage one, I’d want to hunt a
woodchuck hole and hiberate.”</p>

<p>“Hibernate,” Jean corrected absently.</p>

<p>Now, one active principle in the Robbins
family was interest in each other’s affairs. It
was called by various names. Doris said it was
“nosing.” Helen called it “petty curiosity.”
But Kit came out flatly and said it was based
primarily on inherent family affection; that necessarily
every twig of a family tree must be intensely
and vitally interested in every single
thing that affected any sister twig. Accordingly,
she deserted her catalogues with their enticing
pictures of flowering bulbs, and, leaning over
Jean’s chair, demanded to know the cause of her
absorption.</p>

<p>“Bab Crane is taking up expression.” Jean
turned back to the first page of the letter she
had been reading. “She says she never fully
realized before that art is only the highest form
of expressing your ideals to the world at large.”</p>

<p>“Tell her she’s all wrong.” Kit shook her mop
of boyish curls decidedly. “Cousin Roxy told
me the other day she believes schools were first
invented for the relief of distressed parents just
to give them a breathing spell, and not for
children at all.”</p>

<p>“Still, if Bab’s hit a new trail of interest, it
will make her think she’s really working. Things
have come to her so easily, she doesn’t appreciate
them. Perhaps she can express herself now.”</p>

<p>“Express herself? For pity’s sake, Jeanie.
Tell her to come up here, and we’ll let her express
herself all over the place. Oh! Just smell my
mince pies this minute. Isn’t cooking an expression
of individual art too?” said Kit teasingly
as she made a bee line for the oven in time to
rescue four mince pies.</p>

<p>“Who’s going to drive down after the Christmas
box?” Mrs. Robbins glanced in at the group
in the sunlight. “I wish to send an order for
groceries too and you’ll want to be back before
dark.”</p>

<p>“I’m terribly sorry, Mother dear,” called Kit
from the kitchen, “but Sally and some of the
girls are coming over and I promised them I’d
go after evergreen and Princess pine. We’re
gathering it for wreaths and stars to decorate the
church.”</p>

<p>“And I promised Father if his magazines
came, I’d read to him,” Helen added. “And
here they are, so I can’t go.”</p>

<p>“Dorrie and I’ll go. I love the drive.” Jean
handed Bab’s letter over to Kit to read, and gave
just a bit of a sigh. Not a real one, only a bit
of a one. Nobody could possibly have sustained
any inward melancholy at Greenacres. There
was too much to be done every minute of the day.
Kit often said she felt exactly like “Twinkles,”
Billie’s gray squirrel, whirling around in its cage.</p>

<p>Still, Bab’s letter did bring back strongly the
dear old times last winter at the Art Academy.
Perhaps the girl students did take themselves
and their aims too seriously, and had been like
that prince in Tennyson’s “Princess,” who mistook
the shadow for the substance. Yet it had
all been wonderfully happy and interesting.
Even in the hills of rest, she missed the companionship
of girls her own age with the same
tastes and interests as herself.</p>

<p>Shad harnessed up Princess and drove around
to the side porch steps. It seemed as if he grew
taller all the time. When the minister from the
little white church had come to call, he had found
Shad wrapping up the rose bushes in their winter
coats of sacking. Shad stood up, six feet of
lanky, overgrown, shy Yankee boy, and shook
hands.</p>

<p>“Well, well, Shadrach, son, you’re getting
nearer heaven sooner than most of us, aren’t
you?” laughed Mr. Peck. And he was. Grew
like a weed, Shad himself said, but Doris told
him pines grew fast too, and she thought that
some day he’d be a Norway spruce which is used
for ship-masts.</p>

<p>Mrs. Robbins came out carrying her own warm
fur cloak to wrap Doris in, and an extra lap robe.</p>

<p>“Better take the lantern along,” advised Shad,
in his slow drawling way. “Looks like snow and
it’ll fall dark kind of early.”</p>

<p>He went back to the barn and brought a
lantern to tuck in under the seat. Princess,
dancing and side stepping in her anxiety to be
off, took the road with almost a scamper. Her
winter coat was fairly long now, and Doris said
she looked like a Shetland pony.</p>

<p>It was seven miles to Nantic, but the girls
never tired of the ride. It was so still and dream-like
with the early winter silence on the land.
They passed only Jim Barlow, driving his yoke
of silver gray oxen up from the lumber mill with
a load of logs to be turned into railroad ties, and
Sally’s father with a load of grain, waving his
whipstock in salute to them.</p>

<p>Sally herself was at the “ell” door of the big
mill house, scraping out warm cornmeal for her
white turkeys. She saluted them too with the
wooden spoon.</p>

<p>“I’m going after evergreen as soon as I get
my dishes washed up,” she called happily.
“Goodbye.”</p>

<p>Along the riverside meadows they saw the two
little Peckham boys driving sheep with Shep,
their black and white dog, barking madly at the
foot of a tall hickory tree.</p>

<p>“Got a red squirrel up there,” called Benny,
proudly.</p>

<p>“Sally says they’re making all their Christmas
presents themselves,” said Doris, thinking of the
large family the mill house nested. “They always
do, every year. She says she thinks presents
like that are ever so much more loving than
those you just go into a store and buy. She’s
got them all hidden away in her bureau drawer,
and the key’s on a ribbon around her neck.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t we make a lot of things too, pigeon?
Birchbark, hand-painted cards, and pine pillows,
and sweet fern boxes. Mother says she never
enjoyed getting ready for Christmas so much as
this year. Wait a minute.” Jean spied some
red berries in the thicket overhanging the rail
fence.</p>

<p>She handed Doris the reins, and jumping from
the carriage, climbed the fence to reach the
berries. Down the road came the hum of an automobile,
a most unusual sound on Gilead highways.
Princess never minded them and Doris
turned out easily for the machine to pass.</p>

<p>The driver was Hardy Philips, the store
keeper’s son at Nantic. He swung off his cap at
sight of Jean. She surely made an attractive
picture with the background of white birches
against red oak and deep green pine, and over
one shoulder the branches of red berries. The
two people on the back seat looked back at her,
slim and dark as some wood sprite, with her home
crocheted red cap and scarf to match, with one
end tossed over her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Somebody coming home for Christmas, I
guess,” she said, getting back into the carriage
with her spoils. “Princess, you are the dearest
horse about not minding automobiles. Some
stand right up and paw the air when one goes by.
You’ve got the real Robbins’ poise and disposition.”</p>

<p>Doris was snuggling down into the fur robe.</p>

<p>“My nose is cold. I wish I had a mitten for it.
It’s funny, Jeanie. I don’t mind the cold a bit
when I walk through the woods to school, but I
do when we’re driving.”</p>

<p>“Snuggle under the rug. We’ll be there
pretty soon.”</p>

<p>Jean drove with her chin up, eyes alert, cheeks
rosy. There was a snap in the air that “perked
you right up,” as Cousin Roxy would say, and
Princess covered the miles lightly, the click of
her hoofs on the frozen road almost playing a
dance <span class='it'>tempo</span>. When they stopped at the hitching
post above the railroad tracks, Doris didn’t
want to wait in the carriage, so she followed Jean
down the long flight of wooden steps that led to
the station platform from the hill road above.
And just as they opened the door of the little
stuffy express office, they caught the voice of Mr.
Briggs, the agent, not pleasant and sociable as
when he spoke to them, but sharp and high
pitched.</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t loaf around here, son, I tell
you that right now. The minute I spied you
hiding behind that stack of ties down the track,
I knew you’d run away from some place, and I’m
going to find out all about you and let your folks
know you’re caught.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t got any folks,” came back a boy’s
voice hopefully. “I’m my own boss and can go
where I please.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear that, Miss Robbins?” exclaimed
Mr. Briggs, turning around at the opening of
the door. “Just size him up, will you. He says
he’s his own boss, and he ain’t any bigger than a
pint of cider. Where did you come from?”</p>

<p>“Off a freight train.”</p>

<p>Mr. Briggs leaned his hands on his knees and
bent down to get his face on a level with the
boy’s.</p>

<p>“Ain’t he slick, though? Can’t get a bit of
real information out of him except that he liked
the looks of Nantic and dropped off the slow
freight when she was shunting back and forth up
yonder. What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Joe. Joe Blake.” He didn’t look at Mr.
Briggs, but off at the hills, wind swept and bare
except for their patches of living green pines.
There was a curious expression in his eyes, Jean
thought, not loneliness, but a dumb fatalism. As
Cousin Roxy might have put it, it was as if all
the waves and billows of trouble had passed over
him, and he didn’t expect anything better.</p>

<p>“How old are you?”</p>

<p>“ ’Bout nine or ten.”</p>

<p>“What made you drop off that freight here?”</p>

<p>Joe was silent and seemed embarrassed.
Doris caught a gleam of appeal in his glance and
responded instantly.</p>

<p>“Because you liked it best, isn’t that why?” she
suggested eagerly. Joe’s face brightened up at
that.</p>

<p>“I liked the looks of the hills, but when I saw
all them mills I—I thought I’d get some work
maybe.”</p>

<p>“You’re too little.” Mr. Briggs cut short
that hope in its upspringing. “I’m going to
hand you right over to the proper authorities, and
you’ll land up in the State Home for Boys if you
haven’t got any folks of your own.”</p>

<p>Joe met the shrewd, twinkly grey eyes doubtfully.
His own filled with tears reluctantly, big
tears that rose slowly and dropped on his worn
short coat. He put his hand up to his shirt collar
and held on to it tightly as if he would have kept
back the ache there, and Jean’s heart could stand
it no longer.</p>

<p>“I think he belongs up at Greenacres, please,
Mr. Briggs,” she said quickly. “I know Father
and Mother will take him up there if he hasn’t
any place to go, and we’ll look after him. I’m
sure of it. He can drive back with us.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t know where he came from nor
anything about him, Miss Robbins. I tell you
he’s just a little tramp. You can see that, or he
wouldn’t be hitching on to freight trains. That
ain’t no way to do if you’re decent God-fearing
folks, riding the bumpers and dodging train-men.”</p>

<p>“Let me take him home with me now, anyway,”
pleaded Jean. “We can find out about him
later. It’s Christmas Friday, you know, Mr.
Briggs.”</p>

<p>There was no resisting the appeal that underlay
her words and Mr. Briggs capitulated gracefully,
albeit he opined the county school was the
proper receptacle for all such human rubbish.</p>

<p>Jean laughed at him happily, as he stood
warming himself by the big drum stove, his feet
wide apart, his hands thrust into his blue coat
pockets.</p>

<p>“It’s your own doings, Miss Robbins,” he
returned dubiously. “I wouldn’t stand in your
way so long as you see fit to take him along.
But he’s just human rubbish. Want to go, Joe?”</p>

<p>And Joe, knight of the bumpers, rose, wiping
his eyes with his coat sleeve, and glared resentfully
back at Mr. Briggs. At Jean’s word, he
shouldered the smaller package and carted it up
to the waiting carriage while Mr. Briggs leisurely
came behind with the wooden box.</p>

<p>“Guess you’ll have to sit on that box in the
back, Joe,” Jean said. “We’re going down to
the store, and then home. Sit tight.” She
gathered up the reins. “Thank you ever and
ever so much, Mr. Briggs.”</p>

<p>It was queer, Mr. Briggs said afterwards, but
nobody could be expected to resist the smile of a
Robbins. He swung off his cap in salute, watching
the carriage spin down the hill, over the long
mill bridge and into the village with the figure of
Joe perched behind on the Christmas box.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span><h1>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>CHRISTMAS GUESTS</span></h1></div>

<p>Helen caught the sound of returning wheels
on the drive about four o’clock. It was nearly
dark. She stood on the front staircase, leaning
over the balustrade to reach the big wrought iron
hall lamp. When she opened the door widely,
its rays shining through the leaded red glass, cast
a path of welcome outside.</p>

<p>“Hello, there,” Jean called. “We’re all here.”</p>

<p>Doris jumped to the ground and took Joe by
the hand, giving it a reassuring squeeze. He was
shivering, but she hurried him around to the
kitchen door and they burst in where Kit was getting
supper. Over in a corner lay burlap sacks
fairly oozing green woodsy things for the Christmas
decoration at the church, and Kit had
fastened up one long trailing length of ground
evergreen over an old steel engraving of Daniel
Webster that Cousin Roxy had given them.</p>

<p>“He ain’t as pretty as he might be,” she had
said, pleasantly, “but I guess if George Washington
was the father of his country, we’ll have to
call Daniel one of its uncles.”</p>

<p>“Look, Kit,” Doris cried, quite as if Joe had
been some wonderful gift from the fairies instead
of a dusty, tired, limp little derelict of fate and
circumstance. “This is Joe, and he’s come to
stay with us. Where’s Mother?”</p>

<p>One quick look at Joe’s face checked all
mirthfulness in Kit. There were times when
silence was really golden. She was always intuitive,
quick to catch moods in others and understand
them. This case needed the Motherbird.
Joe was fairly blue from the cold, and there was
a pinched, hungry look around his mouth and
nose that made Kit leave her currant biscuits.</p>

<p>“Upstairs with Father. Run along quick and
call her, Dorrie.” She knelt beside Joe and
smiled that radiant, comradely smile that was
Kit’s special present from her fairy godmother.
“We’re so glad you’ve come home,” she said,
drawing him near the crackling wood fire. “You
sit on the woodbox and just toast.” She slipped
back into the pantry and dipped out a mug of
rich, creamy milk, then cut a wide slice of warm
gingerbread. “There now. See how that tastes.
You know, it’s the funniest thing how wishes
come true. I was just longing for somebody to
sample my cake and tell me if it was good. Is
it?”</p>

<p>Joe drank nearly the whole glass of milk before
he spoke, looking over the rim at her with very
sleepy eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s awful good,” he said. “I ain’t had
anything to eat since yesterday morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” cried Kit. This was beyond her.
She turned with relief at Mrs. Robbins’ quick
light step in the hall.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, I know. Jeanie told me.” She
put Kit to one side, and went straight over to the
wood box. And she did just the one right thing.
That was the marvel of the Motherbird. She
seemed always to know naturally what a person
needed most and gave it to them. Down she
stooped and took Joe in her arms, his head on her
shoulder, patting him while he began to cry chokingly.</p>

<p>“Never mind, laddie, now,” she told him.
“You’re home.” She lifted him to her lap and
started to untie his worn sodden shoes. “Doris,
get your slippers, dear, and a pair of stockings
too, the heavy ones. Warm the milk, Kit, it’s
better that way. And you cuddle down on the
old lounge by the sitting room fire, Joe, and rest.
That’s our very best name for the world up here,
did you know it? We call it our hills of rest.”</p>

<p>Shad came in breezily, bringing the Christmas
boxes and a shower of light snow. He stared at
the stranger with a broad grin of welcome.</p>

<p>“Those folks that went up in the automobile
stopped off at Judge Ellis’s. Folks from Boston,
I understood Hardy to say. He just
stopped a minute to ask what was in the boxes,
so I thought I’d inquire too.”</p>

<p>Nothing of interest ever got by the Greenacre
gate posts if Shad could waylay it. Helen asked
him to open the boxes right away, but no, Shad
would not. And he showed her where it was
written, plain as could be, in black lettering along
one edge:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

<p>Mrs. Robbins had gone into the sitting room
and found a gray woolen blanket in the wall
closet off the little side hall. From the chest of
drawers she took some of Doris’s outgrown winter
underwear. Supper was nearly ready, but
Joe was to have a warm bath and be clad in clean
fresh clothing. Tucking him under one wing, as
Kit said, she left the kitchen and Jean told the
rest how she had rescued him from Mr. Briggs’s
righteous indignation and charitable intentions.</p>

<p>“Got a good face and looks you square in the
eye,” said Shad. “I’d take a chance on him any
day, and he can help around the place a lot,
splitting kindlings, and shifting stall bedding and
what not.”</p>

<p>The telephone bell rang and Jean answered.
Rambling up through the hills from Norwich was
the party line, two lone wires stretching from
home-hewn chestnut poles. Its tingling call
was mighty welcome in a land where so little of
interest or variation ever happened. This time
it was Cousin Roxy at the other end. After her
marriage to the Judge, they had taken the long
deferred wedding trip up to Boston, visiting relatives
there, and returning in time for a splendid
old-fashioned Thanksgiving celebration at the
Ellis homestead. Maple Lawn was closed for
the winter but Hiram, the hired man, “elected”
as he said, to stay on there indefinitely and work
the farm on shares for Miss Roxy as he still called
her.</p>

<p>“And like enough,” Cousin Roxy said comfortably,
when she heard of his intentions, “he’s
going to marry somebody himself. I wouldn’t
put it past him a mite. I wish he’d choose
Cindy Anson. There she is living alone down in
that little bit of a house, running a home bakery
when she’s born to fuss over a man. I told
Hiram when I left, if I was him I’d buy all my
pies and cake from Cindy, and then when I drove
by Cindy’s I just dropped a passing word about
how badly I felt at leaving such a fine man as
Hiram to shift for himself up at the house, so she
said she’d keep an eye on him.”</p>

<p>“But, Cousin Roxy,” Jean had objected,
“that’s match-making.”</p>

<p>“Maybe ’tis so,” smiled Roxy placidly. “But
I always did hold to it that Cupid and Providence
both needed a sight of jogging along to keep
them stirring.”</p>

<p>Over the telephone now came her voice, vibrant
and cheery, and Jean answered the call.</p>

<p>“Hello, yes, this is Jean. Mother’s right in
the sitting room. Who? Oh, wait till I tell the
girls.” She turned her head; her brown eyes
sparkling. “Boston cousins over at the Judge’s.
Who did you say they are, Cousin Roxy? Yes?
Cousin Beth and Elliott Newell. I’ll tell
Father right away. Tomorrow morning early?
That’s splendid. Goodbye.”</p>

<p>Before the girls could stop her, she was on her
way upstairs. The largest sunniest chamber had
been turned into the special retiring place of the
king, as Helen called her father.</p>

<p>“All kings and emperors had some place where
they could escape from formality and rest up,”
she had declared. “And Plato loved to hide
away in his olive grove, so that is Dad’s. Somebody
else, I think it’s Emerson, says we ought
to keep an upper chamber in our souls, well swept
and garnished, with windows wide.”</p>

<p>“Not too wide this kind of weather, Helenita,”
Jean interrupted, for Helen’s wings of poetry
were apt to flutter while she forgot to shake her
duster. Still, it was true, and one of the charms
of the old Mansion House was its spaciousness.
There were many rooms, but the pleasantest of
all was the “king’s thinking place.”</p>

<p>The months of relaxation and rest up in the
hills had worked wonders in Mr. Robbins’ health.
As old Dr. Gallup was apt to say when Kit rebelled
at the slowness of recovery,</p>

<p>“Can’t expect to do everything in a minute.
Even the Lord took six days to fix things the
way he liked them.”</p>

<p>Instead of spending two-thirds of his time in
bed or on the couch now, he would sit up for
hours and walk around the wide porch, or even
along the garden paths before the cold weather
set in. But there still swept over him without
warning the great fatigue and weakness, the
dizziness and exhaustion which had followed as
one of the lesser ills in his nervous breakdown.</p>

<p>He sat before the open fire now, reading from
one of his favorite weeklies, with Gladness purring
on his knees. Doris had found Gladness
one day late in October, dancing along the barren
stretch of road going over to Gayhead school, for
all the world like a yellow leaf. She was a yellow
kitten with white nose and paws. Also, she undoubtedly
had the gladsome carefree disposition
of the natural born vagabond, but Doris had
tucked her up close in her arms and taken her
home to shelter.</p>

<p>Some day, the family agreed, when all hopes
and dreams had come true, Doris would erect all
manner and kind of little houses all over the hundred
and thirty odd acres around the Mansion
House and call them Inns of Rest, so she would
feel free to shelter any living creature that was
fortunate enough to fall by the wayside near
Greenacres’ gate posts.</p>

<p>Cousin Roxy had looked at the yellow kitten
with instant recognition.</p>

<p>“That’s a Scarborough kitten. Sally Scarborough’s
raised yellow kittens with white paws
ever since I can remember.”</p>

<p>“Had I better take it back?” asked Doris
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Land, no, child. It’s a barn cat. You can
tell that, it’s so frisky. Ain’t got a bit of repose
or common sense. Like enough Mis’ Scarborough’d
be real glad if it had a good home.
Give it a happy name, and feed it well, and it’ll
slick right up.”</p>

<p>So Gladness had remained, but not out in the
barn. Somehow she had found her way up to
the rest room and its peace must have appealed
to her, for she would stay there hours, dozing with
half closed jade green eyes and incurved paws.
Kit said she had taken Miss Patterson’s place as
nurse, and was ever so much more dependable
and sociable to have around.</p>

<p>“Father, dear,” Jean exclaimed, entering the
quiet room like an autumn flurry of wind.
“What do you think? Cousin Roxy has just
’phoned, and she wants me to tell you two Boston
cousins are there. Did you hear the machine go
up this afternoon? Beth and Elliott Newell.
Do you remember them?”</p>

<p>“Rather,” smiled Mr. Robbins. “It must be
little Cousin Beth and her boy. I used to visit
at her old home in Weston when I was a little
boy. She wanted to be an artist, I know.”</p>

<p>Jean had knelt before the old gray rock fireplace,
slipping some light sticks under the big
back log. At his last words she turned with
sudden interest and sat down cross legged on the
rug just as if she had been a little girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, father, an artist? And did she study and
succeed?”</p>

<p>“I think so. I remember she lived abroad for
some time and married there. Her maiden name
was Lowell, Beth Lowell.”</p>

<p>“Did she marry an artist too?” Jean leaned
forward, her eyes bright with romance, but Mr.
Robbins laughed.</p>

<p>“No, indeed. She married Elliott’s father, a
schoolmate from Boston. He went after her,
for I suppose he tired of waiting for Beth’s
career to come true. Listen a minute.”</p>

<p>Up from the lower part of the house floated
strains of music. Surely there had never issued
such music from a mouth organ. It quickened
one into action like a violin’s call. It proclaimed
all that a happy heart might say if it had a mouth
organ to express itself with. And the tune was
the old-fashioned favorite of the fife and drum
corps, “The Girl I Left Behind Me.”</p>

<p>“It must be Joe,” Jean said, smiling mischievously
up at her father, for Joe was still unknown
to the master of the house. She ran out to the
head of the stairs.</p>

<p>“Can Joe come up, Motherie?”</p>

<p>Up he came, fresh from a tubbing, wearing
Doris’s underwear, and an old shirt of Mr. Robbins’,
very much too large for him, tucked into his
worn corduroy knee pants. His straight blonde
hair fairly glistened from its recent brushing and
his face shone, but it was Joe’s eyes that won him
friends at the start. Mixed in color they were
like a moss agate, with long dark lashes, and just
now they were filled with contentment.</p>

<p>“They wanted me to play for them downstairs,”
he said gravely, stopping beside Mr.
Robbins’ chair. “I can play lots of tunes. My
mother gave me this last Christmas.”</p>

<p>This was the first time he had mentioned his
mother and Jean followed up the clue gently.</p>

<p>“Where, Joe?”</p>

<p>He looked down at the burning logs, shifting
his weight from one foot to the other.</p>

<p>“Over in Providence. She got sick and they
took her to the hospital and she never came back.”</p>

<p>“Not at all?”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“Then, afterwards,—” much was comprised in
that one word and Joe’s tone, “afterwards we
started off together, my Dad and me. He said
he’d try and get a job on some farm with me,
but nobody wanted him this time of year, and
with me too. And he said one morning he wished
he didn’t have me bothering around. When I
woke up on the freight yesterday morning, he
wasn’t there. Guess he must have dropped off.
Maybe he can get a job now.”</p>

<p>So it slipped out, Joe’s personal history, and
the girls wondered at his soldierly acceptance of
life’s discipline. Only nine, but already he faced
the world as his own master, fearless and optimistic.
All through that first evening he sat in
the kitchen on the cushioned wood box, playing
tunes he had learned from his father. When
Shad brought in his big armfuls of logs for the
night, he executed a few dance figures on the
kitchen floor and “allowed” before he got
through Joe would be chief musician at the country
dances roundabout.</p>

<p>After supper the girls drew up their chairs
around the sitting room table as usual. Here
every night the three younger ones prepared their
lessons for the next day. Jean generally read
or sat with her father awhile, but tonight she
answered Bab Crane’s letter. It was read over
twice, the letter that blended in so curiously with
the coming of the cousins from Boston.</p>

<p>Ever since Jean could remember she had
drawn pictures. In her first primer, treasured
with other relics of that far off time when she was
six instead of seventeen, she had put dancey legs
on the alphabet and drawn very fat young pigs
with curly tails chasing each other around the
margins of spellers.</p>

<p>No one guessed how she loved certain paintings
back at the old home in New York. They had
seemed so real to her, the face of a Millet peasant
lad crossing a stubble field at dawn; a Breton
girl knitting as she walked homeward behind
some straying sheep; one of Franz Hals’ Flemish
lads, his chin pressed close to his violin, his deep
eyes looking at you from under the brim of his
hat, and Touchstone and Audrey wandering
through the Forest of Arden.</p>

<p>She had loved to read, as she grew older, of
Giotto, the little Italian boy trying to mix colors
from brick dust, or drawing with charcoal on the
stones of the field where Cimabue the monk
walked in meditation; of the world that was just
full of romance, full of stories ages old and still
full of vivid life.</p>

<p>Once she had read of Albrecht Durer, painting
his masterpieces while he starved. How the
people told in whispers after his death that he
had used his heart’s blood to mix with his wonderful
pigments. Of course it was all only a
story, but Jean remembered it. When she saw
a picture that seemed to hold one and speak its
message of beauty, she would say to herself,</p>

<p>“There is Durer’s secret.”</p>

<p>And some day, if she ever could put on canvas
the dreams that came to her, she meant to use the
same secret.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Kit, yawning and stretching
her arms out in a perfect ecstasy of relaxation
after a bout with her Latin, “I do think Socrates
was an old bore. Always mixing in and contradicting
everybody and starting something.
No wonder his wife was cranky.”</p>

<p>“He died beautifully,” Helen mused. “Something
about a sunset and all his friends around
him, and didn’t he owe somebody a chicken and
tell his friends to pay for it?”</p>

<p>“You’re sleepy. Go to bed, both of you,”
Jean told them laughingly. “I’ll put out the
light and fasten the doors.”</p>

<p>She finished her letter alone. It was not easy
to write it. Bab wanted her to come down for
the spring term. She could board with her if
she liked. Expenses were very light.</p>

<p>Any expenses would be heavy if piled on the
monthly budget of Greenacres. Jean knew that.
So she wrote back with a heartache behind the
plucky refusal, and stepped out on the moonlit
veranda for a minute. It was clear and cold
after the light snowfall. The stars were very
faint. From the river came the sound of the
waterfall, and up in the big white barn, Princess
giving her stall a goodnight kick or two before
settling down.</p>

<p>“You stand steady, Jean Robbins,” she said,
between her teeth. “Don’t you dare be a quitter.
You stand steady and see this winter straight
through.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span><h1>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>EVERGREEN AND CANDLELIGHT</span></h1></div>

<p>After her marriage to Judge Ellis, Cousin
Roxy had taken Ella Lou from Maple Lawn
over to the big white house behind its towering
elms.</p>

<p>“I’ve been driving her ten years and never saw
a horse like her for knowingness and perspicacity,”
she would say, her head held a little bit
high, her spectacles half way down her nose. “I
told the Judge if he wanted me he’d have to take
Ella Lou too.”</p>

<p>So it was Ella Lou’s familiar white nose that
showed at the hitching post the following morning
when the Boston cousins came over to get
acquainted.</p>

<p>Jean never forgot her introduction to Beth
Newell. She was about forty-seven then, with
her son Elliott fully five inches taller than herself,
but she looked about twenty-seven. Her
fluffy brown hair, her wide gray eyes, and quick
sweet laughter, endeared her to the girls right
away.</p>

<p>“And she’s so slim and dear,” Doris added.
“Her dress makes me think of an oak leaf in
winter, and she’s a lady of the meads.”</p>

<p>Elliott was about fifteen, not one single bit
like his mother, but broad-shouldered and blonde
and sturdy. It was so much fun, Kit said, to
watch him take care of his mother.</p>

<p>“Where’s your High School out here?” he
asked. “I’m at Prep. specializing in mathematics.”</p>

<p>“And how any son of mine can adore mathematics
is beyond me,” Cousin Beth laughed. “I
suppose it’s reaction. Do you like them, Jean?”
She put her arm around the slender figure nearest
her.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I don’t,” Jean answered fervently,
and then all at once, out popped her heart’s desire
before she could check the words. Anybody’s
heart’s desire would pop out with Beth’s
eyes coaxing it. “I—I want to be an artist.”</p>

<p>“Keep on wishing and working then, dear, and
as Roxy says, if it is to be it will be.”</p>

<p>While the others talked of turning New England
farms into haunts of ancient peace and
beauty, these two sat together on the davenport,
Jean listening eagerly and wistfully while her
cousin told of her own girlhood aims and how she
carried them out.</p>

<p>“We didn’t have much money, so I knew I
had to win out for myself. There were two little
brothers to help bring up, and Mother was not
strong, but I used to sketch every spare moment
I could, and I read everything on art I could
find, even articles from old magazines in the
garret. But most of all I sketched anything and
everything, studying form and composition.
When I was eighteen, I taught school for two
terms in the country. Father had said if I
earned the money myself, I could go abroad, and
how I worked to get that first nest egg.”</p>

<p>“How much did you get a week?”</p>

<p>“Twelve dollars, but my board was only three
and a half in the country, and I saved all I could.
During the summers I took lessons at Ellen
Brainerd’s art classes in Boston and worked as a
vacation substitute at the libraries. You know,
Jean, if you really do want work and kind of
hunt a groove you’re fitted for, you will always
find something to do.”</p>

<p>Jean was leaning forward, her chin propped
on her hands.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” she said. “Do go on, please.”</p>

<p>“Ellen Brainerd was one of New England’s
glorious old maids with the far vision and cash
enough to make a few of her dreams come true.
Every year she used to lead a group of girl art
students over Europe’s beauty spots, and with
her encouragement I went the third year, helping
her with a few of the younger ones, and paying
part of my tuition that way. And, my dear,”
Cousin Beth clasped both hands around her knees
and rocked back and forth happily, “we set up
our easels in the fountain square in Barcelona
and hunted Dante types in Florence. We
trailed through Flanders and Holland and lived
delightfully on the outskirts of Paris in a little
gray house with a high stone wall and many
flowers.”</p>

<p>“And you painted all those places?” exclaimed
Jean. “I’ve longed and longed to go there.”</p>

<p>“Well, I tried to,” Cousin Beth looked ruefully
at the fire. “Yes, I tried to paint like all the old
masters and new masters. One month we took
up this school and the next we delved into something
else, studying everything in the world but
individual expression.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what a girl friend of mine in New
York wrote and said she was doing,” cried Jean,
much interested.</p>

<p>“Then she’s struck the keynote. After your
second cousin David came over and stopped my
career by marrying me I came back home. We
lived out near Weston and I began painting
things of everyday life just as I saw them, the
things I loved. It was our old apple tree out
by the well steeped in full May bloom that
brought me my first medal.”</p>

<p>“Oh, after Paris and all the rest!”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear. And the next year they accepted
our red barn in a snowstorm. I painted it from
the kitchen window. Another was a water color
of our Jersey calves standing knee deep in the
brook in June, and another was Brenda, the hired
girl, feeding turkeys out in the mulberry lane.
That is the kind of picture I have succeeded
with. I think because, as I say, they are part of
the home life and scenes I love best and so I have
put a part of myself into them.”</p>

<p>“Durer’s heart’s blood,” Jean said softly.
“You’ve helped me so much, Cousin Beth. I
was just hungry to go back to the art school
right now, and throw up everything here that I
ought to do.”</p>

<p>“Keep on sketching every spare moment you
can. Learn form and color and composition.
Things are only beautiful according to the measure
of our own minds. And the first of March
I want you to visit me. I’ve got a studio right
out in my apple orchard I’ll tuck you away in.”</p>

<p>“I’d love to come if Mother can spare me.”
Jean’s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>“Well, do so, child,” Cousin Roxy’s hands were
laid on her shoulders from behind. “I’m going
up too along that time, and I’ll take you. It’s
a poor family that can’t support one genius.”
She laughed in her full hearted, joyous way.
“Now, listen, all of you. I’ve come to invite you
to have Christmas dinner with us.”</p>

<p>“But, Cousin Roxy,” began Mrs. Robbins,
“there are so many of us—”</p>

<p>“Not half enough to fill the big old house.
Some day after all the girls and Billie are married
and there are plenty of grandchildren, then
we can talk about there being too many, though
I doubt it. There’s always as much house room
as there is heart room, you know, if you only
think so. They’re going to have a little service
for the children at the Center Church, Wednesday
night, and Shad had better drive the girls
over. Bring along the little lad too.” She
smiled over her shoulder at Joe, seated in his
favorite corner on the woodbox reading one of
Doris’s books, and he gave a funny little onesided
grin back in shy return. “Billie’s going
away to school after New Year’s, did I tell you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me,” cried Kit, so spontaneously
that everyone laughed at her. “Doesn’t it seem
as if boys get all of the adventures of life just
naturally.”</p>

<p>“He’s had adventures enough, but he does
need the companionship of boys his own size.
Emerson says that the growing boy is the natural
autocrat of creation, and I don’t want him to be
tied down with a couple of old folks like the
Judge and myself. You’re never young but
once. Besides, I always did want to go to these
football games at colleges and have a boy of mine
in the mixup, bless his heart.”</p>

<p>“My goodness!” Kit exclaimed after the front
door had closed on the last glimpse of Ella Lou’s
white feet going down the drive. “Doesn’t it
seem as if Cousin Roxy leaves behind her a big
sort of glow? She can say more nice things in a
few minutes than anybody I ever heard. Except
about Billie’s going away. I wonder why
he didn’t come down and tell me himself.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know, Kit,” Helen remarked, “you
haven’t a mortgage on Billie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t care if he goes away. It isn’t
that,” Kit answered comfortably. “I wouldn’t
give a snap of my finger for a boy that couldn’t
race with other fellows and win. Jean, fair sister,
did you realize the full significance of Cousin
Roxy’s invitation? No baking or brewing, no
hustling our fingers and toes off for dinner on
Christmas Day. I think she’s a gorgeous old
darling.”</p>

<p>Jean laughed and slipped up the back stairs
to her own room. It was too cold to stay there.
A furnace was one of the luxuries planned for
the following year, but during this first winter
of campaigning, they had started out pluckily
with the big steel range in the kitchen, the genial
square wood heater in the sitting room and open
fire places in the four large bedrooms and the
parlor.</p>

<p>“We’ll freeze before the winter’s over,” Kit
had prophesied. “Now I know why Cotton
Mather and all the other precious old first settlers
of the New England Commonwealth looked
as if their noses had been frost bitten. Sally
Peckham leaves her window wide open every
night, and says she often finds snow on her pillow.”</p>

<p>But already the girls were adapting themselves
to the many ways of keeping warm up in the
hills. On the back of the range at night were
soapstones heating through, waiting to be
wrapped in strips of flannel and trotted up to
bed as foot warmers.</p>

<p>Cousin Roxy had sent over several from her
own store and told the girls if they ran short a
flat iron or a good stick of hickory did almost as
well. It was comical to watch their faces. If
ever remembrance was written on a face it was
on Helen’s the first time she took her soapstone
to bed with her. Where were the hot water coils
of yester year? Heat had seemed to come
as if by magic at the big house at Shady
Cove, but here it became a lazy giant you petted
and cajoled and watched eternally to keep him
from falling asleep. Kit had nicknamed the
kitchen stove Matilda because it reminded her of
a shiny black cook from Aiken, Georgia, whom
the family had harbored once upon a time.</p>

<p>“And feeding Matilda has become one of the
things that is turning my auburn tinted locks a
soft, delicate gray,” she told Helen. “I know if
any catastrophe were to happen all at once, my
passing words would be, ‘Put a stick of wood in
the stove.’ ”</p>

<p>Jean felt around in her desk until she found
her folio of sketches. The sitting room was deserted
excepting for Helen watering the rows of
blooming geraniums on the little narrow shelves
above the sash curtains. Cherilee, the canary,
sang challengingly to the sunlight, and out in the
dining-room Doris was outmatching him with
“Nancy Lee.”</p>

<p>Helen went upstairs to her father, and Kit
appeared with a frown on her face, puzzling over
a pattern for filet lace.</p>

<p>“I think the last days before Christmas are
terrible,” she exclaimed savagely. “What on
earth can we concoct at this last minute for Cousin
Beth? I think I’ll crochet her a filet breakfast
cap. It’s always a race at the last minute to
cover everybody, and you bite off more than you
can chew and always forget someone you wouldn’t
have neglected for anything. What on earth can
I give to Judge Ellis?”</p>

<p>“Something useful,” Jean answered.</p>

<p>“I can’t bear useful things for Christmas presents.
Abby Tucker says she never gets any winter
clothes till Christmas and then all the family
unload useful things on her. I’m going to send
her a bottle of violet extract in a green leather
case. I’ve had it for months and never touched
it and she’ll adore it. I wish I could think of
something for Billie too, something he’s never
had and always wanted.”</p>

<p>“He’s going away,” Jean mused. “Why
don’t you fix up a book of snapshots taken all
around here. We took some beauties this summer.”</p>

<p>“A boy wouldn’t like that.”</p>

<p>“He will when he’s homesick.” Jean opened
her folio and began turning over her art school
studies. Mostly conventionalized designs they
were. After her talk with Cousin Beth they only
dissatisfied her. Suddenly she glanced up at the
figure across the table, Kit with rumpled short
curls and an utterly relaxed posture, elbows on
table, knees on a chair. There was a time for
all things, Kit held, even formality, but, as she
loved to remark sententiously when Helen or
Jean called her up for her lax ways, “A little
laxity is permissible in the privacy of one’s own
home.”</p>

<p>Jean’s pencil began to move over the back of
her drawing pad. Yes, she could catch it. It
wasn’t so hard, the ruffled hair, the half averted
face. Kit’s face was such an odd mixture of
whimsicality and determination. The rough
sketch grew and all at once Kit glanced up and
caught what was going on.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s me, isn’t it, Jean? I wish you’d conventionalized
me and embellished me. I’d like
to look like Mucha’s head of Bernhardt as
Princess Lointaine. What shall we call this?
‘Beauty Unadorned.’ No. Call it ‘Christmas
Fantasies.’ That’s lovely, specially with the
nose screwed up that way and my noble brow
wrinkled. I like that. It’s so subtle. Anyone
getting one good look at the helpless frenzy in
that downcast gaze, those anguished, rumpled
locks—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Kit, be good,” laughed Jean. She held
the sketch away from her critically. “Looks
just like you.”</p>

<p>“All right. Hang it up as ‘Exhibit A’ of
your new school of expression. I don’t mind.
There’s a look of genius to it at that.”</p>

<p>“One must idealize some,” Jean replied teasingly.
She hung it on the door of the wall closet
with a pin, just as Mrs. Robbins came into the
room.</p>

<p>“Mother dear, look what my elder sister has
done to me,” Kit cried tragically. Jean said
nothing, only the color rose slowly in her cheeks
as her mother stood before the little sketch in
silence, and slipped her hand into hers.</p>

<p>“It’s the first since I left school,” she said, half
ashamed of the effort and all it implied. “Kit
looked too appealing. I had to catch her.”</p>

<p>“Finish it up, girlie, and let me have it on the
tree, may I?” There was a very tender note in
the Motherbird’s voice, such an understanding
note.</p>

<p>“Oh, would you like it, really, Mother?”</p>

<p>“Love it,” answered Mother promptly. “And
don’t give up the ship, remember. Perhaps we
may be able to squeeze in the spring term after
all.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span><h1>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE JUDGE’S SWEETHEART</span></h1></div>

<p>It took both Ella Lou and Princess to
transport the Christmas guests from Greenacres
over to the Ellis place. Nobody ever called it
anything but just that, the Ellis place, and sometimes,
“over to the Judge’s.” Cousin Roxy said
she couldn’t bear to have a nameless home and
just as soon as she could get around to it, she’d
see that the Ellis place had a suitable name.</p>

<p>It was one of the few pretentious houses in all
three of the Gileads, Gilead Green, Gilead
Centre, and Gilead Post Office. For seven generations
it had been in the Ellis family. The
Judge had a ponderous volume bound in heavy
red morocco, setting forth the history of Windham
County, and the girls loved to pore over it.
Seven men with their families, bound westward
towards Hartford in the colonial days of seeking
after home sites, had seen the fertile valley with
its encircling hills, and had settled there. One
was an Ellis and the Judge had his sword and
periwig in his library. As for the rest, all one
had to do was go over to the old family burial
ground on the wood road and count them up.</p>

<p>During the fall, this had been a favorite tramp
of the Greenacre hikers, and Jean loved to quote
a bit from Stevenson, once they had come in sight
of the old grass grown enclosure, cedar shaded,
secluded and restful:</p>

<p>“There is a certain frame of mind to which a
cemetery is if not an antidote, at least an alleviation.
If you are in a fit of the blues, go nowhere
else.”</p>

<p>Here they found the last abiding place of old
Captain Ephraim Ellis with his two wives,
Lovina Mary and Hephzibah Waiting, one on
each side of him. The Captain rested betwixt
the two myrtle covered mounds and each old
slate gravestone leaned towards his.</p>

<p>“Far be it from me,” Cousin Roxy would say
heartily, “to speak lightly of those gone before,
but those two headstones tell their own story,
and I’ll bet a cookie the Captain could tell his
if he got a chance.”</p>

<p>Every Legislature convening at Hartford
since the olden days, had known an Ellis from
Gilead. Only two of the family had taken to
wandering, Billie’s father and Gideon, one of the
old Captain’s sons. The girls wove many tales
around Gideon. He must have had the real
Argonaut spirit. Back in the first days of the
Revolution he had run away from the valley
home and ended up with Paul Jones on the
“Bonhomme Richard.”</p>

<p>Billie loved his memory, the same as he did his
own father’s, and the girls had straightened up
his sunken slatestone record, and had planted
some flowers, not white ones, but bravely tinted
asters for late fall. Billie showed them an old
silhouette he had found. Mounted on black silk,
the old faded brown paper showed a boy with
sensitive mouth and eager lifted chin, queer high
choker collar and black stock. On the back of
the wooden frame was written in a small, firm
handwriting, “My beloved son Gideon, aged
nineteen.”</p>

<p>The old house sat far back from the road with
a double drive curving like a big “U” around it.
Huge elms upreared their great boughs protectingly
before it, and behind lay a succession of all
manner and kind of buildings from the old forge
to the smoke house. One barn stood across the
road and another at the top of the lane for hay.
Since Cousin Roxy had married the Judge, it
seemed as if the sunlight had flooded the old
house. Its shuttered windows had faced the
road for years, but now the green blinds were
wide open, and it seemed as if the house almost
smiled at the world again.</p>

<p>“I never could see a mite of sense in keeping
blinds shut as if somebody were dead,” Cousin
Roxy would say. “Some folks won’t even open
the blinds in their hearts, let alone their houses,
so I told the Judge if he wanted me for a companion,
he’d have to take in God’s sunshine too,
’cause I can’t live without plenty of it.”</p>

<p>Kit and Doris were the first to run up the steps
and into the center hall, almost bumping into
Billie as he ran to meet them. Behind him came
Mrs. Ellis in a soft gray silk dress. A lace
collar encircled her throat, fastened with an old
pink cameo breast-pin. Helen had always
coveted that pin. There was a young damsel
on it holding up her full skirts daintily as she
moved towards a sort of chapel, and it was set in
fine, thin old gold.</p>

<p>“Come right in, folkses,” she called happily.
“Do stop capering,” as Doris danced around her.
“Merry Christmas, all of you.”</p>

<p>Up the long colonial staircase she led the way
into the big guest room. Down in the parlor
Cousin Beth was playing softly on the old melodeon,
“It came upon the midnight clear, that
glorious song of old.” The air was filled with
scent of pine and hemlock, and provocative
odors of things cooking stole up the back stairs.</p>

<p>Kit and Billie retreated to a corner with the
latter’s book supply. It was hard to realize that
this was really Billie, Cousin Roxy’s “Nature
Boy” of the summer before. Love and encouragement
had seemed to round out his character
into a promise of fulfilment in manliness.
All of the old self consciousness and shy abstraction
had gone. Even the easy comradely
manner in which he leaned over the Judge’s arm
chair showed the good understanding and sure
confidence between the two.</p>

<p>“Yes, he does show up real proud,” Cousin
Roxy agreed warmly with Mrs. Robbins when
they were all downstairs before the glowing fire.
“Of course I let him call me Grandma. Pity
sakes, that’s little enough to a love starved child.
I’m proud of him too and so’s the Judge. We’re
going to miss him when he goes away to school,
but he’s getting along splendidly. I want him
to go where he’ll have plenty of boy companionship.
He’s lived alone with the ants and bees
and rabbits long enough.”</p>

<p>Helen and Doris leaned over Cousin Beth’s
shoulders trying the old carols: “Good King
Wencelas,” “Carol, Brothers, Carol,” and “While
Shepherds Watched Their Flocks By Night.”
Jean played for them and just before dinner was
announced, Doris sang all alone in her soft
treble, very earnestly and tenderly, quite as if
she saw past the walls of the quiet New England
homestead to where “Calm Judea stretches far
her silver mantled plains.”</p>

<p>Cousin Roxy rocked back and forth softly,
her hand shading her eyes as it did in prayer.
When it was over, she said briskly, wiping off
her spectacles,</p>

<p>“Land, I’m not a bit emotional, but that sort
of sets my heart strings tingling. Let’s go to
dinner, folkses. The Judge takes Betty in, and
Jerry takes Beth. Then Elliott can take in his
old Cousin Roxy, and I guess Billie can manage
all of the girls.”</p>

<p>But the girls laughingly went their own way,
Doris holding to the Judge’s other arm and
Helen to her father’s, while Jean lingered behind
a minute to glance about the cheery room. The
fire crackled down in the deep old rock hearth.
In each of the windows hung a mountain laurel
wreath tied with red satin ribbon. Festoons of
ground pine and evergreen draped each door and
picture. It was all so homelike, Jean thought.
Over the mantel hung a motto worked in colored
worsteds on perforated silver board.</p>

<div class='bbox2'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>Here abideth peace</p>

</div>

<p>But Jean turned away, and pressed her face
against the nearest window pane, looking down
at the sombre, frost-touched garden. There
wasn’t one bit of peace in her heart, even while
she fairly ached with the longing to be like the
others.</p>

<p>“You’re a coward, Jean Robbins, a deliberate
coward,” she told herself. “You don’t like the
country one bit. You love the city where everybody’s
doing something, and it’s just a big race
for all. You’re longing for everything you
can’t have, and you’re afraid to face the winter
up here. You might just as well tell yourself
the truth. You hate to be poor.”</p>

<p>There came a burst of laughter from the dining-room
and Kit calling to her to hurry up. It
appeared that Doris, the tender-hearted, had
said pathetically when Mrs. Gorham, the “help,”
brought in the great roast turkey: “Poor old
General Putnam!”</p>

<p>“That isn’t the General,” Billie called from
his place. “The General ran away yesterday.”</p>

<p>Now if Cousin Roxy prided herself on one
thing more than another it was her flock of white
turkeys led by the doughty General. All summer
long the girls had looked upon him as a definite
personality to be reckoned with. He was
patriarchal in the way he managed his family.
And it appeared that the General’s astuteness
and sagacity had not deserted him when Ben had
started after him to turn him into a savory sacrifice.</p>

<p>“First off, he lit up in the apple trees,” Ben
explained. “Then as soon as he saw I was high
enough, off he flopped and made for the corn-crib.
Just as I caught up with him there, he
chose the wagon sheds and perched on the rafters,
and when I’d almost got hold of his tail feathers,
if he didn’t try the barn and all his wives and
descendants after him, mind you. So I thought
I’d let him roost till dark, and when I stole in
after supper, the old codger had gone, bag and
baggage. He’ll come back as soon as he knows
our minds ain’t set on wishbones.”</p>

<p>“Then who is this?” asked Kit interestedly,
quite as if it were some personage who rested on
the big willow pattern platter in state.</p>

<p>“That is some unnamed patriot who dies for
his country’s good,” said the Judge, solemnly.
“Who says whitemeat and who says dark?”</p>

<p>Jean was watching her father. Not since
they had moved into the country had she seen
him so cheerful and like himself. The Judge’s
geniality was like a radiating glow, anyway, that
included all in its circle, and Cousin Roxy was
in her element, dishing out plenteous platefuls of
Christmas dainties to all those nearest and
dearest to her. Way down at the end of the
table sat Joe, wide eyed and silent tongued.
Christmas had never been like this that he knew
of. Billie tried to engage him in conversation,
boy fashion, a few times, but gave up the attempt.
By the time he had finished his helping,
Joe was far too full for utterance.</p>

<p>In the back of the carriage, driving over from
Greenacres, Mrs. Robbins had placed a big
bushel basket, and into this had gone the gifts to
be hung on the tree. After dinner, while the
Judge and Mr. Robbins smoked before the fire,
and Kit led the merry-making out in the sitting
room, there were mysterious “goings on” in the
big front parlor. Finally Cousin Beth came
softly out, and turned down all the lights.</p>

<p>Jean slipped over to the organ, and as the tall
old doors were opened wide, she played softly,</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Gather around the Christmas tree.”</p>

</div>

<p>Doris picked up the melody and led, sitting on
a hassock near the doors, gazing with all her eyes
up at the beautiful spreading hemlock, laden
with lights and gifts.</p>

<p>“For pity’s sake, child, what are you crying
about?” exclaimed Cousin Roxy, almost stumbling
over a little crumpled figure in a dark corner,
and Joe sobbed sleepily:</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s just the heartache and the beauty of
it all,” said Helen fervently. “He’s lonely for
his own folks.”</p>

<p>“ ’Tain’t neither,” groaned Joe. “It’s too
much mince pie.”</p>

<p>So under Cousin Roxy’s directions, Billie took
him up to his room, and administered “good hot
water and sody.”</p>

<p>“Too bad, ’cause he missed seeing all the
things taken off the tree,” said Cousin Roxy,
laying aside Joe’s presents for him, a long warm
knit muffler from herself, a fine jack-knife from
the Judge with a pocket chain on it, a package
of Billie’s boy books that he had outgrown,
and ice skates from the Greenacre girls. After
much figuring over the balance left from their
Christmas money they had clubbed together on
the skates for him, knowing he would have more
fun and exercise out of them than anything, and
he needed something to bring back the sparkle
to his eyes and the color to his cheeks.</p>

<p>“Put them all up on the bed beside him, and
he’ll find them in the morning,” Billie suggested.
“If you’ll let him stay, Mrs. Robbins, I’ll bring
him over.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it queer,” Doris said, with a sigh of
deepest satisfaction, as she watched the others
untying their packages. “It isn’t so much what
you get yourself Christmas, it’s seeing everybody
else get theirs.” And just then a wide,
flat parcel landed squarely in her lap, and she
gave a surprised gasp.</p>

<p>“The fur mitten isn’t there, but you can
snuggle your nose on the muff,” Jean told her,
and Doris held up just what she had been longing
for, a squirrel muff and stole to throw
around her neck. “They’re not neighborhood
squirrels, are they, Billie?” she whispered anxiously,
and Billie assured her they were Russian
squirrels, and no families’ trees around Gilead
were wearing mourning.</p>

<p>Nearly all of Billie’s presents were books.
He had reached the age where books were like
magical windows through which he gazed from
Boyhood’s tower out over the whole wide world
of romance and adventure. Up in his room
were all of the things he had treasured in his
lonesome days before the Judge had married
Miss Robbins: his home-made fishing tackle, his
collection of butterflies and insects, his first
compass and magnifying glass, the flower
calendar and leaf collection, where he had arranged
so carefully every different leaf and
blossom in its season.</p>

<p>But now, someway, with the library of books
the Judge had given him, that had been his own
father’s, Gilead borders had widened out, and he
had found himself a knight errant on the world’s
highway of literature. He sat on the couch now,
burrowing into each new book until Kit sat down
beside him, with a new kodak in one hand and a
pair of pink knit bed slippers in the other.</p>

<p>“And mother’s given me the picture I like
best, her Joan of Arc listening to the voices in
the garden at Arles. I love that, Billie. I’m
not artistic like Jean or romantic like Helen.
You know that, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Billie nodded emphatically. Indeed he did
know it after half a year of chumming with Kit.</p>

<p>“But I love the pluck of Joan,” Kit sighed,
lips pursed, head up. “I’d have made a glorious
martyr, do you know it? I know she must have
enjoyed the whole thing immensely, even if it
did end at the stake. I think it must be ever so
much easier to be a martyr than look after the
seventeen hundred horrid little everyday things
that just have to be done. When it’s time to get
up now at 6 <span class='sc'>A. M.</span> and no fires going, I
shall look up at Joan and register courage and
valor.”</p>

<p>Helen sat close to her father, perfectly happy
to listen and gaze at the flickering lights on the
big tree. She had gift books too, mostly fairy
tales and what Doris called “princess stories,”
a pink tinted ivory manicure set in a little velvet
box, and two cut glass candlesticks with little
pink silk shades. The candlesticks had been
part of the “white hyacinths” saved from the
sale at their Long Island home, and Jean had
made the shades and painted them with sprays
of forget-me-nots. Cousin Roxy had knit the
prettiest skating caps for each of the girls, and
scarfs to match, and Mrs. Newell gave them old
silver spoons that had been part of their great
great-grandmother Peabody’s wedding outfit,
and to each one two homespun linen sheets from
the same precious store of treasures.</p>

<p>“When you come to Weston,” she told Jean,
“I’ll show you many of her things. She was
my great grandmother, you know, and I can
just vaguely remember her sitting upstairs in
her room in a deep-seated winged armchair that
had pockets and receptacles all around it. I
know I looked on her with a great deal of wonder
and veneration, for I was just six. She wore
gray alpaca, Jean, silver gray like her hair, and
a little black silk apron with dried flag root in
one pocket and pink and white peppermints in
the other.”</p>

<p>“And a cap,” added Jean, just as if she too
could recall the picture.</p>

<p>“A cap of fine black lace with lavender bows,
and her name was Mary Lavinia Peabody.”</p>

<p>“I’d love to be named Mary Lavinia,” quoth
Kit over her shoulder. “How can anybody be
staid and faithful unto death with ‘Kit’ hurled
at them all day. But if I had been rightly called
Mary Lavinia, oh, Cousin Beth, I’d have been a
darling.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it one bit,” laughed Cousin
Beth merrily. “Go along with you, Kit. It
just suits you.”</p>

<p>Doris sat on her favorite hassock clasping a
new baby doll in her arms with an expression of
utter contentment on her face. Kit and Jean
had dressed it in the evenings after she had gone
to bed, and it had a complete layette. But
Billie had given her his tame crow, Moki, and
her responsibility was divided.</p>

<p>“Where’d you get the name from, Billie?” she
asked.</p>

<p>Billie stroked the smooth glossy back of the
crow as one might a pet chicken.</p>

<p>“I found him one day over in the pine woods
on the hill. He was just a little fellow then.
The nest was in a dead pine, and somebody’d shot
it all to pieces. The rest of the family had gone,
but I found him fluttering around on the ground,
scared to death with a broken wing. Ben
helped me fix it, and he told me to call him Moki.
You know he’s read everything, and he can talk
some Indian, Pequod mostly, he says. He isn’t
sure but what there may be some Pequod in him
way back, he can talk it so well, and Moki means
‘Watch out’ in Pequod, Ben says. I call him
that because I used to put him on my shoulder
and he’d go anywhere with me through the
woods, and call out when he thought I was in
danger.”</p>

<p>“How do you know what he thought?”</p>

<p>“After you get acquainted with him, you’ll
know what he thinks too,” answered Billie
soberly. “Hush, grandfather’s going to say
something.”</p>

<p>The Judge rose and stood on the hearth rug,
his back to the fire. He was nearly six feet tall,
soldierly, and rugged, his white curly hair standing
out in three distinct tufts just like Pantaloon,
Kit always declared, his eyes keen and bright
under their thick brows. He had taken off his
eyeglasses and held them in one hand, tapping
them on the other to emphasize his words.
Jean tiptoed around the tree, extinguishing the
last sputtering candles, and sat down softly beside
Cousin Roxy.</p>

<p>“I don’t think any of you, beloved children
and dear ones, can quite understand what tonight
means to me personally.” He cleared his
throat and looked over at Billie. “I haven’t had
a real Christmas here since Billie’s father was a
little boy. I didn’t want a real Christmas either.
Christmas meant no more to me than to some
old owl up in the woods, maybe not as much.
But tonight has warmed my heart, built up a
good old fire in it just as you start one going in
some old disused rock fireplace that has been
stone cold for years.</p>

<p>“When I was a boy this old house used to be
opened up as it is tonight, decorated with evergreen
and hemlock and guests in every room at
Christmas time. I didn’t live here then. My
grandfather, old Judge Winthrop Ellis, was
alive, and my father had married and moved
over to the white house on the wood road between
Maple Lawn and the old burial ground.
You can still find the cellar of it and the old rock
chimney standing. I used to trot along that
wood road to school up at Gayhead where Doris
and Helen have been going, and I had just one
companion on that road, the perkiest, sassiest,
most interesting female I ever met in all my
life.” He stopped and chuckled, and Cousin
Roxy rubbed her nose with her forefinger and
smiled.</p>

<p>“We knew every spot along the way, where
the fringed gentians grew in the late fall, and
where to find arbutus in the spring. The best
place to get black birch and where the checker-berries
were thickest. Maybe just now, it won’t
mean so much to you young folks, all these little
landmarks of nature on these old home roads
and fields of ours, but when the shadows begin
to lengthen in life’s afternoon, you’ll be glad to
remember them and maybe find them again, for
the best part of it all is, they wait for you with
love and welcome and you’ll find the gentians
and the checker-berries growing in just the same
places they did fifty years ago.”</p>

<p>Jean saw her father put out his hand and lay
it over her mother’s. His head was bent forward
a trifle and there was a wonderful light in
his eyes.</p>

<p>“And all I wanted to say, apart from the big
welcome to you all, and the good wishes for a
joyous season, was this, the greatest blessing life
has brought me is that Roxana has come out of
the past to sit right over there and show me how
to have a good time at Christmas once again.
God bless you all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, wasn’t he just a dear,” Kit said, rapturously,
when it was all over, and they were driving
back home under the clear starlit sky. “I
do hope when I’m as old as the Judge, I’ll have
a flower of romance to sniff at too. Cousin
Roxy watched him just as if he were sixteen instead
of sixty.”</p>

<p>“You’re just as sentimental as Helen and
me,” Jean told her, teasingly.</p>

<p>“Well, anybody who wouldn’t get a thrill out
of tonight would be a toad in a claybank. And
Jean, did you see Father’s face?”</p>

<p>Jean nodded. It was something not to be
discussed, the light in her father’s face as he had
listened. It made her realize more than anything
that had happened in the long months of
trial in the country, how worth while it was, the
sacrifice that had brought him back into his home
country for healing and happiness.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span><h1>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>JUST A CITY SPARROW</span></h1></div>

<p>Christmas week had already passed when the
surprise came. As Kit said the charm of the
unexpected was always gripping you unawares
when you lived on the edge of Nowhere. Mrs.
Newell and Elliott had departed two days after
Christmas for Weston. Somehow the girls
could not get really acquainted with this new
boy cousin. Billie, once won, was a friend for
ever, but Elliott was a smiling, confident boy,
quiet and resourceful, with little to say.</p>

<p>“He overlooks girls,” Helen had said. “It
isn’t that he doesn’t like us, but he doesn’t see
us. He’s been going to a boys’ school ever since
he was seven years old, and all he can think
about or talk about is boys. When I told him
I didn’t know anything about baseball, he looked
at me through his eye glasses so curiously.”</p>

<p>“I think he was embarrassed by such a galaxy
of the fair cousins,” Kit declared. “He’s lived
alone as the sole chick, and he just couldn’t get
the right angle on us. Billie says he got along
with him all right. He was very polite, girls,
anyway. You expect too much of him because
Cousin Beth was so nice. If he’d been named
Bob or Dave or Billie or Jack, he’d have felt
different too. His full name’s Elliott Peabody
Newell. I’ll bet a cookie when I have a large
family, I’ll never, never give them family
names.”</p>

<p>“You said you were going to be a bachelor
maid forever just the other day.”</p>

<p>“Did I? Well, you know about consistency
being the hobgoblin of little minds,” Kit retorted
calmly. “Since we were over at the
Judge’s for Christmas, I’ve decided to marry
my childhood love too.”</p>

<p>“That’s Billie.”</p>

<p>“No, it is not, young lady. Billie is a kindred
spirit, an entirely different person from your
childhood love. I haven’t got one yet, but after
listening to the Judge say those tender things
about Cousin Roxy, I’m going to find one or
know the reason why.”</p>

<p>By this time, Jean had settled down contentedly
to the winter régime. She was giving Doris
piano lessons, and taking over the extra household
duties with Kit back at school. School had
been one of the problems to be solved that first
year. Doris and Helen went over the hill road
to Gayhead District Schoolhouse. It stood at
the crossroads, a one story red frame building,
with a “leanto” on one side, and a woodshed on
the other. Helen had despised it thoroughly
until she heard that her father had gone there
in his boyhood, and she had found his old desk
with his initials carved on it. Anything that
Father or Mother had been associated with was
forever hallowed in the eyes of the girls.</p>

<p>But Kit was in High School, and the nearest
one was over the hills to Central Village, six
miles away. As Kit said, it was so tantalizing
to get to the top of the first hill and see the square
white bell tower rising out of the green trees way
off on another hill and not be able to fly across.
But Piney was going and she rode horseback on
Mollie, the brown mare.</p>

<p>“And if Piney Hancock can do it, I can,” Kit
said. “I shall ride Princess over and back.
Piney says she’ll meet me down at the bridge
crossing every morning. It will be lots of fun,
and she knows where we can put the horses up.
All you do is take your own bag of grain with
you, and it only costs ten cents to stable them.”</p>

<p>“But, dear, in heavy winter weather what will
you do?”</p>

<p>“Piney says if it’s too rough to get home, she
stays overnight with Mrs. Parmalee. You remember,
Mother dear, Ma Parmalee from
whom we bought the chickens. I could stay too.
Cousin Roxy says you mustn’t just make a virtue
of Necessity, sometimes you have to take her
into the bosom of the family.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, Kit rode in good weather, a trim,
lithe figure in her brown corduroy cross saddle
skirt, pongee silk waist, and brown tie. After
she reached Central Village, and Princess was
stabled, she could button up her skirt and feel
just as properly garbed as any of the girls. And
the ride over the rounded hills in the late fall
months was a wonderful tonic. Mrs. Robbins
would often stand out on the wide porch of an
early morning and watch the setting forth of her
brood, Helen and Doris turning to wave back
to her at the entrance gates, Kit swinging her
last salute at the turn of the hill road, where
Princess got her first wind after her starting
gallop.</p>

<p>“I think they’re wonderfully plucky,” she said
one morning to Jean. “If they had been country
girls, born and bred, it would be different,
but stepping right out of Long Island shore
life into these hills, you have all managed
splendidly.”</p>

<p>“We’d have been a fine lot of quitters if we
hadn’t,” Jean answered. “I think it’s been
much harder for you than for us girls, Mother
darling.”</p>

<p>And then the oddest, most unexpected thing
had happened, something that had strengthened
the bond between them and made Jean’s way
easier. The Motherbird had turned, with a certain
quick grace she had, seemingly as girlish and
impulsive as any of her daughters, and had met
Jean’s glance with a tell-tale flush on her cheeks
and a certain whimsical glint in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Jean, do you never suspect me?” she had
asked, half laughingly. “I know just exactly
what a struggle you have gone through, and how
you miss all that lies back yonder. I do too. If
we could just divide up the time, and live part
of the year here and the other part back at the
Cove. I wouldn’t dare tell Cousin Roxy that I
had ever ‘repined’ as she would say, but there are
days when the silence and the loneliness up here
seem to crush so strongly in on one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother! I never thought that you
minded it.” Jean’s arms were around her in a
moment. “I’ve been horribly selfish, just thinking
of myself. But now that Father’s getting
strong again, you can go away, can’t you, for a
little visit anyway?”</p>

<p>“Not without him,” she said decidedly. “Perhaps
by next summer we can, I don’t know. I
don’t want to suggest it until he feels the need
of a change too. But I’ve been thinking about
you, Jean, and if Babbie writes again for you to
come, I want you to go for a week or two anyway.
I’ll get Shad’s sister to help me with the
housework, and you must go. Beth and I had
a talk together before she left, and I felt proud
of my first nestling’s ambitions after I heard her
speak of your work. She says the greatest
worry on her mind is that Elliott has no definite
ambition, no aim. He has always had everything
that they could give him, and she begins
now to realize it was all wrong. He expects
everything to come to him without any effort of
his own.”</p>

<p>“But, Mother, how can I go and leave you—”</p>

<p>“I want you to, Jean. You have been a great
help to me. Don’t think I haven’t noticed everything
you have done to save me worry, because
I have.”</p>

<p>“Well, you had Father to care for—”</p>

<p>“I know, and he’s so much better now that I
haven’t any dread left. If Babbie writes again
tell her you will come.”</p>

<p>Babbie wrote after receiving her Christmas
box of woodland things. Jean had arranged it
herself, not thinking it was bearing a message.
It was lined with birch bark, and covered with
the same. Inside, packed in moss, were hardy
little winter ferns, sprays of red berries, a wind
tossed bluebird’s nest, acorns and rose seed pods,
and twined around the edge wild blackberry
vines that turn a deep ruby red in wintertime.
Jean called it a winter garden and it was one of
several she had sent out to city friends for whom
she felt she could not afford expensive presents.</p>

<p>Babbie had caught the real spirit of it, and
had written back urgently.</p>

<p>“You must run down if only for a few days,
Jean. I’ve put your winter garden on the studio
windowsill in the sunlight, and it just talks at
me about you all the time. Never mind about
new clothes. Come along.”</p>

<p>It was these same new clothes that secretly
worried Jean all the same, but with some fresh
touches on two of last year’s evening frocks, her
winter suit sponged and pressed, and her mother’s
set of white fox furs, she felt she could make the
trip.</p>

<p>“You can wear that art smock in the studio
that Bab sent you for Christmas,” Kit told her.
“That funny dull mustard yellow with the Dutch
blue embroidery just suits you. But do your
hair differently, Jean. It’s too stiff that way.
Fluff it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you do it, Jean,” Helen advised.
“Just because Kit has a flyaway mop, she
doesn’t want us to wear braids. I shall wear
braids some day if my hair ever gets long enough.
I love yours all around your head like that. It
looks like a crown.”</p>

<p>“Stuff!” laughed Kit, merrily. “Sit thee
down, my sister, and let me turn thee into a radiant
beauty.”</p>

<p>Laughingly, Jean was taken away from her
sewing and planted before the oval mirror. The
smooth brown plaits were taken down and Kit
deftly brushed her hair high on her head, rolled
it, patted it, put in big shell pins, and fluffed out
the sides around the ears.</p>

<p>“Now you look like Mary Lavinia Peabody
and Dolly Madison and the Countess Potocka.”</p>

<p>“Do I?” Jean surveyed herself dubiously.
“Well, I like the braids best, and I’d never get
it up like that by myself. I shall be individual
and not a slave to any mode. You know what
Hiram used to say about his plaid necktie, ‘Them
as don’t like it can lump it for all of me.’ ”</p>

<p>The second week in January Shad drove Princess
down to the station with Jean and her two
suitcases tucked away on the back seat. Mr.
Briggs glanced up in bold surprise when her face
appeared at the ticket window.</p>

<p>“Ain’t leaving us, be you?”</p>

<p>“Just for a week or two. New York, please.”</p>

<p>“New York? Well, well.” He turned and
fished leisurely for a ticket from the little rack
on the side wall. “Figuring on visiting friends
or maybe relatives, I shouldn’t wonder?”</p>

<p>“A girl friend.” Jean couldn’t bear to sidestep
Mr. Briggs’s friendly interest in the comings
and goings of the Robbins family. “Miss
Crane.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Miss Crane. Same one you sent
down that box to by express before Christmas.
Did she get it all right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks.”</p>

<p>“I kind of wondered what was in it. Nothing
that rattled, and it didn’t feel heavy.” He
looked out at her meditatively, but just then the
train came along and Jean had to hurry away
without appeasing Mr. Briggs’s thirst for information.</p>

<p>It was strange, the sensation of adventure that
came over her as the little two coach local train
wound its way around the hills down towards
New London. The unexpected, as she had said
once, always brought the greatest thrill, and she
had put from her absolutely any hope of a trip
away from home so that now it came as a double
pleasure.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon and the sunshine lay in a
hazy glow of red and gold over the russet fields.
There was no sign of snow yet. The land lay
in a sort of sleepy stillness, without wind or sound
of birds, waiting for the real winter. On the
hillsides the laurel bushes kept their deep green
lustre, the winter ferns reared brave fresh tinted
fronds above the dry leaf mold. On withered
goldenrod stalks tiny brown Phoebe birds clung,
hunting for stray seed pods. Here and there
rose leisurely from a pine grove a line of crows,
flying low over the bare fields.</p>

<p>The train followed the river bank all the way
down to New London. Jean loved to watch the
scenery as it flashed around the bends, past the
great water lily ponds below Jewett City, past
the tumbling falls above the mills, over a bridge
so narrow that it seemed made of pontoons,
through beautiful old Norwich, sitting like Rome
of old on her seven hills, the very “Rose of New
England.” Then down again to catch the broad
sweep of the Thames River, ever widening until
at last it spread out below the Navy Yard and
slipped away to join the blue waters of the
Sound.</p>

<p>It was all familiar and common enough
through custom and long knowledge to the people
born and bred there. Jean thought an outsider
caught the perspective better. And how many
of the old English names had been given in loving
remembrance of the Mother country, New London
and Norwich, Hanover, Scotland, Canterbury,
Windham, and oddly enough, wedged in
among the little French Canadian settlements
around Nantic was Versailles. How on earth,
Jean wondered, among those staid Non-Conformist
villages and towns, had Marie Antoinette’s
toy palace ever slipped in for remembrance.</p>

<p>At New London she had to change from the
local train to the Boston express. It was eleven
before she reached the Grand Central at New
York and found Bab waiting for her. Jean saw
her as she came up the Concourse, a slim figure
in gray, her fluffy blonde hair curling from under
her gray velvet Tam, just as Kit had coaxed
Jean’s to do. Beside her was Mrs. Crane, a
little motherly woman, plump and cheerful, who
always reminded Jean of a hen that had just
hatched a duck’s egg and was trying to make the
best of it.</p>

<p>“What a wonderful color you have, child,” she
said, kissing Jean’s rosy cheeks. “She looks a
hundred per cent better, doesn’t she, Bab, since
she left Shady Cove.”</p>

<p>“Fine,” Babbie declared. “Give the porter
your suitcases, Kit. We’ve got a taxi waiting
over here.”</p>

<p>It was very nearly a year since Jean had
left the New York atmosphere. Now the rush
and hurly burly of people and vehicles almost bewildered
her. After months of the silent nights
in the country, the noise and flashing lights
rattled her, as Kit would have expressed it. She
kept close to Mrs. Crane, and settled back finally
in the taxi with relief, as they started uptown for
the studio.</p>

<p>“Yet you can hardly call it a studio now,
since Mother came and took possession,” Bab
said. “We girls had it all nice and messy, and
she keeps it in order, I tell you. But you’ll like
it, and it’s close to the Park so we can get out
for some good hikes.”</p>

<p>“Somebody was needed to keep it in order,”
Mrs. Crane put in. “You know, Jean, I had to
stay over in Paris until things were a little bit
settled. We had a lease on the apartment there,
and of course, they held me to it, so I let Bab
come back with the Setons as she had to be in
time for her fall term at the Academy.”</p>

<p>“Noodles and Justine and I kept house,” Bab
put in significantly. “And, my dear, talk about
temperament! We had no regular meals at all,
and Justine says if you show her crackers and
pimento cheese again for a year, she’ll just simply
die in her tracks. Mother has fed us up beautifully
since she came. Real substantial food,
you know, fixed up differently, Mother fashion.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and they didn’t think they needed me at
all, Jean. Somehow a mother doesn’t go with
a studio equipment, but this one does, and now
everyone in the building troops down to visit us.
They all need mothering now.”</p>

<p>It was one of the smaller brick buildings off
Sixth Avenue on Fifty-Seventh Street. There
had been a garage on the first floor, but Vatelli,
the sculptor, had turned it into a work room with
a wife and three little Vatellis to make it cosy.
The second floor was the Cranes’ apartment, one
very large room and two small ones. The two
floors above were divided into one- and two-room
studios. It looked very unpretentious from the
outside, but within everything was delightfully
attractive. The ceiling was beamed in dark oak,
and a wide fireplace with a crackling wood fire
made Jean almost feel as if she were back home.
There were wide Dutch shelves around the room
and cushioned seats along the walls. An old
fashioned three-cornered piano stood crosswise
at one end, and there were several oak settees and
cupboards. At the windows hung art scrim curtains
next the panes, and within, heavy dark red
ones that shut out the night.</p>

<p>Noodles came barking to meet them, a regular
dowager of a Belgian griffon, plump and consequential,
with big brown eyes and a snub nose.
And smiling archly, with her eyes sparkling,
Justine stood with arms akimbo. She had been
Bab’s nurse years before in France, and had
watched over her ever since. Jean loved the tall,
dark-browed Brittany woman. In her quick
efficient way, she managed Bab as nobody else
could. No one ever looked upon Justine as a
servant. She was distinctly “family,” and Jean
was kissed soundly on both rosy cheeks and complimented
volubly on her improved appearance.</p>

<p>“It’s just the country air and plenty of exercise,
Justine,” she said.</p>

<p>“Ah, but yes, the happy heart too, gives that
look,” Justine answered shrewdly. “I know. I
have it myself in Brittany. One minute, I have
something warm to eat.”</p>

<p>She was gone into the inner room humming to
herself, with Noodles tagging at her high heels.</p>

<p>“Now take off your things and toast,” Bab
said. “There aren’t any bedrooms excepting
Mother’s in yonder. She will have a practical
bedroom to sleep in, but we’ll curl up on the
couches out here, and Justine has one. Oh, Jean,
come and sing for me this minute.”</p>

<p>Coat and hat off, she was at the piano, running
over airs lightly, not the songs of Gilead, but
bits that made Jean’s heart beat faster; some
from their campfire club out at the Cove, others
from the old art class Bab and she had belonged
to, and then the melody stole into one she had
loved, the gay Chanson de Florian,</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Ah, have you seen a shepherd pass this way?”</p>

</div>

<p>Standing behind her, under the amber glow of
the big silk shaded copper lamp, Jean sang softly,
and all at once, her voice broke.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Bab, glancing up.
“Tired?”</p>

<p>Jean’s lashes were wet with tears.</p>

<p>“I was wishing Mother were here too,” she
answered. “She loves all this so—just as I do.
It’s awfully lonesome up there sometimes without
any of this.”</p>

<p>Bab reached up impulsively and threw her
arms around her.</p>

<p>“I knew it,” she whispered. “I told Mother
just from your letters that you had Gileaditis and
must come down.”</p>

<p>“Gileaditis?” laughed Jean. “That’s funny.
Kit would love it. And it’s what I have got too.
I love the hills and the freedom, but, oh, it is so
lonely. Why, I love even to hear the elevated
whiz by, and the sound of the wheels on the paved
streets again.”</p>

<p>“Jean Robbins,” Bab said solemnly. “You’re
not a country robin at all, you’re a city sparrow.”</p>

<p>Jean slept late the next morning, late for a
Greenacre girl at least. Kit’s alarm clock was
warranted to disturb anybody’s most peaceful
slumbers at 6 <span class='sc'>A. M.</span> sharp, but here, with curtains
drawn, and the studio as warm as toast,
Jean slept along until eight when Justine came
softly into the large room to pull back the heavy
curtains, and say chocolate and toast were nearly
ready.</p>

<p>“Did you close the big house at the Cove?”
Jean asked, while they were dressing.</p>

<p>“Rented it furnished. With Brock away at
college and me here at the Academy, Mother
thought she’d let it go, and stay with me. She’s
over at Aunt Win’s while I’m at classes.
They’ve got an apartment for the winter around
on Central Park South because Uncle Frank
can’t bear commuting in the winter time. We’ll
go over there before you go back home. Aunt
Win’s up to her ears this year in American Red
Cross work, and you’ll love to hear her talk.”</p>

<p>“Do you know, Bab,” Jean said suddenly, “I
do believe that’s what ails Gilead. Nobody up
there is doing anything different this winter from
what they have every winter for the last fifty
years. Down here there’s always something new
and interesting going on.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but is that good? After a while you expect
something new all the time, and you can’t
settle down to any one thing steadily. Coming,
Justine, right away.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, you lazy kittens,” said Mrs.
Crane, laying aside her morning paper in the big,
chintz-cushioned rattan chair by the south window.
“I’ve had my breakfast. I’ve got two
appointments this morning and must hurry.”</p>

<p>“Mother always mortgages tomorrow. I’ll
bet anything she’s got her appointment book
filled for a month ahead. What’s on for today,
dear?”</p>

<p>“Dentist and shopping with your Aunt Win.
I shall have lunch with her, so you girls will be
alone. There are seats for a recital at Carnegie
Hall if you’d enjoy it. I think Jean would.
It’s Kolasky the ’cellist, and Mary Norman.
An American girl, Jean, from the Middle West,
you’ll be interested in her. She sings folk songs
beautifully. Bab only likes orchestral concerts,
but if you go to this, you might drop in later at
Signa’s for tea. It’s right upstairs, you know,
Bab, and not a bit out of your way. Aunt Win
and I will join you there.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t she the dearest, bustling Mother,” Bab
said, placidly, when they were alone. “Sometimes
I feel ages older than she is. She has as
much fun trotting around to everything as if New
York were a steady sideshow. Do you want to
go?”</p>

<p>“I’d love to,” Jean answered frankly. “I’ve
been shut up away from everything for so long
that I’m ready to have a good time anywhere.
Who’s Signa?”</p>

<p>“A girl Aunt Win’s interested in. She’s
Italian, and plays the violin. Jean Robbins, do
you know the world is just jammed full of
people who can do things, I mean unusual things
like painting and playing and singing, better than
the average person, and yet there are only a few
who are really great. It’s such a tragedy because
they all keep on working and hoping and
thinking they’re going to be great. Aunt Win
has about a dozen tucked under her wing that she
encourages, and I think it’s perfectly deadly.”</p>

<p>Bab planted both elbows on the little square
willow table, holding her cup of chocolate aloft,
her straight brows drawn together in a pucker of
perplexity.</p>

<p>“Because they won’t be great geniuses, you
mean?”</p>

<p>“Surely. They’re just half way. All they’ve
got is the longing, the urge forward.”</p>

<p>Jean smiled, looking past her at the view beyond
the yellow curtains and box of winter greens
outside. There was a little courtyard below with
one lone sumac tree in it, and red brick walks.
A black and white cat licked its paws on the side
fence. From a clothes line fluttered three pairs
of black stockings. The voices of the little
Vatellis floated up as they played house in the
sunshine.</p>

<p>“Somebody wrote a wonderful poem about
that,” she said. “I forget the name, but it’s
about those whose aims were greater than their
ability, don’t you know what I mean? It says
that the work isn’t the greatest thing, the purpose
is, the dream, the vision, even if you fall short of it.
I know up home there’s one dear little old lady,
Miss Weathersby. We’ve just got acquainted
with her. She’s the last of three sisters who were
quite rich for the country. Doris found her, way
over beyond the old burial ground, and she was
directing some workmen. Doris said they were
tearing down a long row of old sheds and chicken
houses that shut off her view of the hills. She
said she’d waited for years to clear away those
sheds, only her sisters had wanted them there because
their grandfather had built them. I think
she was awfully plucky to tear them down, so she
could sit at her window and see the hills. Maybe
it’s the same way with Signa and the others. It’s
something if they have the eyes to see the hills.”</p>

<p>“Maybe so,” Bab said briskly. “Maybe I
can’t see them myself, and it’s just a waste of
money keeping me at the Academy. I’m not a
genius, and I’ll never paint great pictures, but I
am going to be an illustrator, and while I’m
learning I can imagine myself all the geniuses
that ever lived. You know, Jean, we were told,
not long ago, to paint a typical city scene. Well,
the class went in for the regulation things, Washington
Arch and Grant’s Tomb, Madison Square
and the opera crowd at the Met. Do you know
what I did?” She pushed back her hair from her
eager face, and smiled. “I went down on the
East Side at Five Points, right in the Italian
quarter, and you know how they’re always
digging up the streets here after the gas mains
or something that’s gone wrong? Well, I found
some workmen resting, sitting on the edge of the
trench eating lunch in the sunlight, and some
kiddies playing in the dirt as if it were sand.
Oh, it was dandy, Jean, the color and composition
and I caught it all in lovely splashes. I just
called it ‘Noon.’ Do you like it?”</p>

<p>“Splendid,” said Jean.</p>

<p>Bab nodded happily.</p>

<p>“Miss Patmore said it was the best thing I had
done, the best in the class. You can find beauty
anywhere if you look for it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s good to be down talking to you
again,” Jean exclaimed. “It spurs one along so
to be where others are working and thinking.”</p>

<p>“Think so?” Bab turned her head with her
funny quizzical smile. “You ought to hear
Daddy Higginson talk on that. He’s head of
the life class. And he runs away to a little slab-sided
shack somewhere up on the Hudson when
he wants to paint. He says Emerson or Thoreau
wrote about the still places where you ‘rest and
invite your soul,’ and about the world making a
pathway to your door, too. Let’s get dressed.
It’s after nine, and I have to be in class at ten.”</p>

<p>It was now nearly a year since Jean herself
had been a pupil at the art school. She had gone
into the work enthusiastically when they had
lived at the Cove on Long Island, making the
trip back and forth every day on the train. Then
had come her father’s breakdown and the need
of the Robbins’ finding a new nest in the hills
where expenses were light. As she turned the
familiar street with Bab, and came in sight of the
gray stone building, she couldn’t help feeling just
a little thrill of regret. It represented so much
to her, all the aims and ambitions of a year before.</p>

<p>As they passed upstairs to Bab’s classroom,
some of the girls recognized her and called out a
greeting. Jean waved her hand to them, but did
not stop. She was too busy looking at the
sketches along the walls, listening to the familiar
sounds through open doors, Daddy Higginson’s
deeply rounded laugh; Miss Patmore’s clear
voice calling to one of the girls; Valleé, the lame
Frenchman, standing with his arm thrown about
a lad’s shoulders, pointing out to him mistakes in
underlay of shadows. Even the familiar smell
of turpentine and paint made her lift her nose as
Princess did to her oats.</p>

<p>“Valleé’s so brave,” Bab found time to say, arranging
her crayons and paper on her drawing
board. “Do you remember the girl from the
west who only wanted to paint marines, Marion
Poole? Well, she joined Miss Patmore’s Maine
class last summer and Valleé went along too, as
instructor. She’s about twenty-four, you know,
older than most of us, but Miss Patmore says she
really has genius. Anyway, she was way out on
the rocks painting and didn’t go back with the
class. And the tide came in. Valleé went after
her, and they say he risked his life swimming out
to save her when he was lame. They’re married
now. See her over there with the green apron
on? They’re giving a costume supper Saturday
night and we’ll go.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t anything to wear,” Jean said hastily.</p>

<p>“Mother’ll fix you up. She always can,” Bab
told her comfortably. “Let’s speak to Miss Patmore
before class. She’s looking at you.”</p>

<p>Margaret Patmore was the girls’ favorite
teacher. The daughter of an artist herself, she
had been born in Florence, Italy, and brought up
there, later living in London and then Boston.
Jean remembered how delightful her noon talks
with her girls had been of her father’s intimate
circle of friends back in Browning’s sunland. It
had seemed so interesting to link the past and
present with one who could remember, as a little
girl, visits to all the art shrines. Jean had always
been a favorite with her. The quiet, imaginative
girl had appealed to Margaret Patmore
perhaps because she had the gift of visualizing
the past and its great dreamers. She took
both her hands now in a firm clasp, smiling down
at her.</p>

<p>“Back again, Jean?”</p>

<p>“Only for a week or two, Miss Patmore,” Jean
smiled, a little wistfully. “I wish it were for
longer. It seems awfully good to be here and
see you all.”</p>

<p>“Have you done any work at all in the country?”</p>

<p>Had she done any work? A swift memory of
the real work of Greenacres swept over Jean,
and she could have laughed.</p>

<p>“Not much.” She shook her head. “I sort of
lost my way for a while, there was so much else
that had to be done, but I’m going to study now.”</p>

<p>“Sit with us and make believe you are back
anyway. Barbara, please show her Frances’s
place. She will not be here for a week.”</p>

<p>So just for one short week, Jean could make
believe it was all true, that she was back as a
“regular.” Every morning she went with Bab,
and joined the class, getting inspiration and
courage even from the teamwork. Late afternoons
there was always something different to
take in. That first day they had gone up to the
recital at Carnegie Hall. Jean loved the ’cello,
and it seemed as if the musician chose all the
themes that always stirred her. Chopin’s Nocturne
in E Flat; one of the Rhapsodies, she could
not remember which, but it always brought to her
mind firelight and gypsies; and a tender, little
haunting melody called “Petit Valse.” Up
home she had played it often for her father at
twilight and it always made her long for the unfulfilled
hopes. And then the “Humoreske,”
whimsical, questioning, it seemed to wind itself
around her heart and tease her about all her
yearnings.</p>

<p>Miss Norman sang Russian folk songs and
some Hebrides lullabies.</p>

<p>“I’m not one bit crazy over her,” said Bab in
her matter-of-fact way. “She looks too wholesome
and solid to be singing that sort of music.
I’d like to see her swing into Brunhilde’s call or
something like that. She’d wake all the babies
up with those lullabies.”</p>

<p>“You make me think of Kit,” Jean laughed.
“She always thinks out loud and says the first
thing that comes to her lips.”</p>

<p>“I know.” Bab’s face sobered momentarily
as they came out of the main entrance and went
around to the studio elevator. “Mother says
I’ve never learned inhibition, and that made me
curious. Of course, she meant it should. So I
hunted up what inhibition meant in psychology
and it did rather stagger me. You act on impulse,
but if you’d only have sense enough to
wait a minute, the nerves of inhibition beat the
nerves of impulse, and reason sets in. I can’t
bear reason, not yet. The only thing I really
enjoyed in Plato was the death of Socrates.”</p>

<p>“That’s funny. Kit said something about that
a little while ago, the sunset, and his telling someone
to pay for a chicken just as he took the
poisoned cup.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to paint it.” Bab’s gray eyes narrowed
as if she saw the scene. “Why on earth
haven’t the great artists done things like that
instead of spotted cows and windmills.”</p>

<p>Before Jean could find an answer, they had
reached Signa Patrona’s studio. It seemed filled
with groups of people. Jean had a confused
sense of many introductions, and Signa herself,
a tall, slender girl in black with a rose made of
gold tissue fastened in her dusky, low coiled hair.
She rarely spoke, but smiled delightfully. The
girls found Mrs. Crane and her sister in a corner.</p>

<p>“Aunt Win,” said Bab. “Here’s your country
girl. Isn’t she blooming? Talk to her while
I get some tea.”</p>

<p>“My dear,” Mrs. Everden surveyed her in a
benevolent, critical sort of fashion, “you’re improved.
The last time I saw you, was out at
Shady Cove. You and your sisters were in some
play I think, given by the Junior Auxiliary
of the Church. You live in the country now,
Barbara tells me. I have friends in the Berkshires.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but we’re way over near the Rhode Island
border,” Jean said quickly. It seemed as if
logically, all people who moved from Long Island
must go to the Berkshires. “It’s real country
up there, Gilead Centre. We’re near the old
Post Road to Boston, from Hartford, but nobody
hardly ever travels over it any more.”</p>

<p>“We might motor over in the spring, Barbara
would enjoy it. Are the roads good in the
spring, my dear?”</p>

<p>Visions of Gilead roads along in March and
April flitted through Jean’s mind. They turned
into quagmires of yellow mud, and where the
frost did take a notion to steal away, the road
usually caved in gracefully after the first spring
rains. Along the end of April after everybody
had complained, Tucker Hicks, the road committeeman,
would bestir himself leisurely and
patch up the worst places. No power in Gilead
had ever been able to rouse Tucker to action before
the worst was over.</p>

<p>“Mother’d dearly love to have you come,” she
said. “The only thing we miss up there is the
friendship of the Cove neighbors. If you
wouldn’t mind the roads, I know you’d enjoy it,
but they are awful in the spring. But nobody
seems to mind a bit. One day down at the
station in Nantic I heard two old farmers talking,
and one said the mud up his way was clear
up to the wheel hubs. ‘Sho,’ said the other. ‘Up
in Gilead, the wheels go all the way down in
some places.’ Just as if they were proud of it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Everden shook her head slowly, and
looked at her sister.</p>

<p>“I can’t even imagine Bess Robbins living in
such a forsaken place.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but it isn’t forsaken,” protested Jean
loyally. “And Mother really enjoys it because
it’s made Father nearly well.”</p>

<p>“And there’s no society at all up there?”</p>

<p>“Well, no, not exactly,” laughed Jean, shaking
her head, “but there are lots of human beings.”</p>

<p>“I could never endure it in this world.”</p>

<p>Jean thought privately that there are many
things one has to learn to endure whether or no,
and someway, just that little talk made her feel
a wonderful love and loyalty towards the Motherbird
holding her home together up in the hills.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span><h1>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE CALL HOME</span></h1></div>

<p>The second evening Aunt Win took them
down to a Red Cross Bazaar at her club rooms.
Jean enjoyed it in a way, although after the open
air life and the quiet up home, overcrowded,
steam-heated rooms oppressed her. She listened
to a famous tenor sing something very fiery in
French, and heard a blind Scotch soldier tell
simply of the comfort the Red Cross supplies
had brought to the little wayside makeshift hospital
he had been taken to, an old mill inhabited
only by owls and martins until the soldiers had
come to it. Then a tiny little girl in pink had
danced and the blind soldier put her on his
shoulder afterwards while she held out his cap.
It was filled with green bills, Jean saw, as they
passed.</p>

<p>Then a young American artist, her face aglow
with enthusiasm, stood on the platform with two
little French orphans, a boy and girl. And she
told of how the girl students had been the first to
start the godmother movement, to mother these
waifs of war.</p>

<p>“Wonderful, isn’t it, the work we’re doing?”
said Aunt Win briskly, when it was over and
they were in her limousine, bound uptown.
“Doesn’t it inspire you, Jean?”</p>

<p>“Not one single bit,” Jean replied fervently.
“I think war is awful, and I don’t believe in it.
Up home we’ve made a truce not to argue about
it, because none of us agree at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, child, I don’t believe in it either, but
if the boys will get into these fights, it always
has fallen to us women and always will, to bind
up the wounds and patch them up the best we
can. They’re a troublesome lot, but we couldn’t
get along without them as I tell Mr. Everden.”</p>

<p>“That sounds just like Cousin Roxy,” Jean
said, and then she had to tell all about who Cousin
Roxy was, and her philosophy and good cheer
that had spread out over Gilead land from Maple
Lawn.</p>

<p>Better than the bazaar, she had liked the little
supper at the Valleé’s studio. Mrs. Crane had
found a costume for her to wear, a white silk
mandarin coat with an under petticoat of heavy
peach blossom embroidery, and Bab had fixed her
dark hair in quaint Manchu style with two big
white chrysanthemums, one over each ear. Bab
was a Breton fisher girl in a dark blue skirt and
heavy linen smock, with a scarlet cap on her
head, and her blonde hair in two long heavy
plaits.</p>

<p>The studio was in the West Forties, over near
Third Avenue. The lower floor had been a
garage, but the Valleé’s took possession of it, and
it looked like some old Florentine hall in dark
oak, with dull red velvet tapestry rugs and hangings.
A tall, thin boy squatted comfortably on
top of a chest across one corner, and played a
Hawaiian ukulele. It was the first time Jean
had heard such music, and it made her vaguely
homesick.</p>

<p>“It always finds the place in your heart that
hurts and wakes it up,” Bab told her. “That’s
Piper Pearson playing. You remember the
Pearsons at the Cove, Talbot and the rest? We
call him Piper because he’s always our maker of
sounds when anything’s doing.”</p>

<p>Piper stopped twanging long enough to shake
hands and smile.</p>

<p>“Coming down to the Cove?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, not this time,” Jean said,
regretfully. She would have loved a visit back
at the old home, and still it might only have made
her dissatisfied. As Kit said, “Beware of the
fleshpots of Egypt when one is living on corn
bread and Indian pudding.”</p>

<p>Marion Valleé remembered her at once, and
had the girls help make sandwiches behind a tall
screen. Rye bread sliced very thin, and buttered
with sweet butter, then devilled crabmeat spread
between. That was Bab’s task. Jean found
herself facing a Japanese bowl of cream cheese,
bottle of pimentoes and some chopped walnuts.</p>

<p>Later there was dancing, Jean’s first dance in
a year, and Mrs. Crane smiled at her approvingly
when she finished and came to her side.</p>

<p>“It’s good to watch you enjoy yourself. Jean,
I want you to meet the youngest of the boys here
tonight. He’s come all the way east from the
Golden Gate to show us real enthusiasm.”</p>

<p>Jean found herself shaking hands with a little
white haired gentleman who beamed at her cheerfully,
and proceeded to tell her all about his new
picture, the Golden Gate at night.</p>

<p>“Just at moonrise, you know, with the reflections
of the signal lights on ships in the water
and the moon shimmer faintly rising. I have
great hopes for it. And I’ve always wanted to
come to New York, always, ever since I was a
boy.”</p>

<p>“He’s eighty-three,” Mrs. Crane found a
chance to whisper. “Think of him adventuring
forth with his masterpiece and the fire of youth
in his heart.”</p>

<p>A young Indian princess from the Cherokee
Nation stood in the firelight glow, dressed in
ceremonial garb, and recited some strange folk
poem of her people, about the “Trail of Tears,”
that path trod by the Cherokees when they were
driven forth from their homes in Georgia to the
new country in the Osage Mountains. Jean
leaned forward, listening to the words, they came
so beautifully from her grave young lips, and last
of all the broken treaty, after the lands had been
given in perpetuity, “while the grass grows and
the waters flow.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t she a darling?” Bab said under her
breath. “She’s a college girl too. I love to
watch her eyes glow when she recites that poem.
You know, Jean, you can smother it under all
you like, not you, of course, but we Americans,
still the Indian is the real thing after all.
Mother Columbia has spanked him and put him
in a corner and told him to behave, but he’s perfectly
right.”</p>

<p>Jean laughed contentedly. In her other ear
somebody else was telling her the Princess was
one fourth Cherokee and the rest Scotch. But
it all stimulated and interested her. As Kit
would have said, there was something new doing
every minute down here. The long weeks of
monotony in Gilead faded away. Nearly every
day after class Mrs. Everden took the girls out
for a spin through the Park in her car, and twice
they went home with her for tea in her apartment
on Central Park South. It was all done in soft
browns and ivories, and Uncle Frank was in
brown and ivory too, a slender soldierly gentleman
with ivory complexion and brown hair just
touched with gray. He said very little, Jean
noticed, but listened contentedly to his wife chat
on any subject in her vivacious way.</p>

<p>“I trust your father is surely recovering up
there,” he said once, as Jean happened to stand
beside him near a window, looking down at the
black swans preening themselves on a tiny island
below. “I often think how much better it would
be if we old chaps would take a playtime now
and then instead of waiting until we’re laid up
for repairs. Jerry was like I am, always too
busy for a vacation. But he had a family to
work for, and Mrs. Everden and I are alone.
I’d like mighty well to see him. What could I
send him that he’d enjoy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” Jean thought anxiously.
“I think he loves to read now, more than anything,
and he was saying just before I left he
wished he had some new books, books that show
the current thought of the day, you know what
I mean, Mr. Everden. I meant to take him up
a few, but I wasn’t sure which ones he would
like.”</p>

<p>“Let me send him up a box of them,” Mr.
Everden’s eyes twinkled. “I’ll wake him up.
And tell him for me not to stagnate up there.
Rest and get well, but come back where he belongs.
There comes a point after a man breaks
down from overwork, when he craves to get back
to that same work, and it’s the best tonic you can
give him, to let him feel and know he’s got his
grip back and is standing firmly again. I’ll send
the books.”</p>

<p>Sunday Bab planned for them to go to service
down at the Church of the Ascension on lower
Fifth Avenue, but Mrs. Crane thought Jean
ought to hear the Cathedral music, and Aunt
Win was to take them in the evening to the Russian
Church for the wonderful singing there.</p>

<p>Jean felt amused and disturbed too, as she
dressed. Up home Cousin Roxy said she didn’t
have a mite of respect for church tramps, those
as were forever gadding hither and yon, seeking
diversion in the houses of the Lord. Still, when
she reached the Cathedral, and heard the familiar
words resound in the great stone interior, she forgot
everything in a sense of reverence and peace.</p>

<p>After service, Mrs. Crane said she must run
into the children’s ward across the street at St.
Luke’s to see how one of her settlement girls was
getting along. Bab and Jean stayed down in
the wide entrance hall, until the latter noticed the
little silent chapel up the staircase at the back.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bab, could we go in, do you think?” she
whispered.</p>

<p>Bab was certain they could, although service
was over. They entered the chapel, and knelt
quietly at the back. It was so different from
the great cathedral over the way, so silent and
shadowy, so filled with the message to the inner
heart, born of the hospital, “In the midst of life
ye are in death.”</p>

<p>“That did me more good than the other,” Jean
said, as they went downstairs to rejoin Mrs.
Crane. “I’m sure worship should be silent, without
much noise at all. Up home the little church
is so small and sort of holy. You just have that
feeling when you go in, and still it’s very plain
and poorly furnished, and we haven’t a vested
choir. The girls sing, and Cousin Roxy plays
the organ.”</p>

<p>Bab sighed.</p>

<p>“Jean, you’re getting acclimated up there. I
can see the signs. Even now your heart’s turning
back home. Never mind. We’ll listen to
Aunt Win’s Russian choir tonight, and that shall
suffice.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon, some friends came in for tea,
and Jean found her old-time favorite teacher,
Daddy Higginson, as all the girls called him at
the school. He was about seventy, but erect and
quick of step as any of the boys; smooth shaven,
with iron gray hair, close cut and curly, and keen,
whimsical brown eyes. He was really splendid
looking, she thought.</p>

<p>“You know, Jeanie,” he began, slipping comfortably
down a trifle in his easy chair, as Bab
handed him a third cup of tea, “you’re looking
fine. How’s the work coming along up there in
your hill country? Doing anything?”</p>

<p>Jean flushed slightly.</p>

<p>“Nothing in earnest, Mr. Higginson. I
rather gave up even the hope of going on with it,
after we went away.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t give it up if it is in you,” he
answered. “That’s one of the charms and blessings
of the divine fire. If it ever does start a
blaze in your soul’s shrine, it can never be put
out. They can smother it down, and stamp on
it, and cover it up with ashes of dead hopes, all
that, but sure as anything, once the mind is relaxed
and at peace with itself, the fire will burn
again. You’re going back, I hear from Bab.”</p>

<p>Jean nodded.</p>

<p>“I’m the eldest, and the others are all in school.
I’m needed.”</p>

<p>He smiled, looking down at the fire Justine
had prepared for them on the wide hearth.</p>

<p>“That’s all right. Anything that tempers
character while you’re young, is good for the
whole system. I was born out west in Kansas,
way back in pioneer days. I used to ride cattle
for my father when I was only about ten. And,
Lord Almighty, those nights on the plains taught
my heart the song of life. I wouldn’t take back
one single hour of them. We lived in a little
dugout cabin, two rooms, that’s all, and my
mother came of a fine old colonial family out of
Colebrook, in your state. She made the trip
with my father and two of us boys, Ned and myself.
I can just remember walking ahead of the
big wagon with my father, chopping down underbrush
and trees for us to get through.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it dangerous?” asked Jean, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Dangerous? No! The Indians we met
hadn’t learned yet that the white man was an
enemy. We were treated well by them. I know
after we got settled in the little house, baking
day, two or three of them would stand outside
the door, waiting while my mother baked bread,
and cake and doughnuts and cookies, in New
England style, just for all the world like a lot
of hungry, curious boys, and she always gave
them some.”</p>

<p>“Did you draw and paint them?”</p>

<p>He laughed, a round, hearty laugh that made
Mrs. Crane smile over at them.</p>

<p>“Never touched a brush until after I was
thirty. I loved color and could see it. I knew
that shadows were purple or blue, and I used to
squint one eye to get the tint of the earth after
we’d ploughed, dull rusty red like old wounds, it
was. First sketch I ever drew was one of my
sister Polly. She stood on the edge of a gully
hunting some stray turkeys. I’ve got the painting
I made later from that sketch. It was exhibited
too, called ‘Sundown.’ ”</p>

<p>“Oh, I saw it,” Jean exclaimed. “The land is
all in deep blues and hyacinth tones and the sky
is amber and the queerest green, and her skirt is
just a dash of red.”</p>

<p>“That’s what she always made me think of, a
dash of red. The red that shows under an
oriole’s wing when he flies. She was seventeen
then. About your age, isn’t that, Jeanie?”</p>

<p>He glanced at her sideways. Jean nodded.</p>

<p>“I thought so, although she looked younger
with her hair all down her back, and short dresses
on.”</p>

<p>“I—I hope she didn’t die,” said Jean, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Die? Bless your heart,” he laughed again.
“She’s living up in Colebrook. Went back over
the old trail her mother had travelled, but in a
Pullman car, and married in the old home town.
Pioneer people live to be pretty old. Just think,
girlie, in your autumn of life, there won’t be any
of us old timers left who can remember what a
dugout looked like or a pioneer ox cart.”</p>

<p>“It must have been wonderful,” Jean said.
“Mother’s from the west too, you know, only
way out west, from California. Her brother has
the big ranch there now where she was born, but
she never knew any hardships at all. Everything
was comfortable and there was always
plenty of money, she says, and it never seemed
like the real west to us girls, when she’d tell of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but it is, the real west of the last forty
years, as it is grown up to success and prosperity.
Ned lives out there still, runs for the State Legislature
now and then, keeps a couple of automobiles,
and his girls can tell you all that’s going on
in the world just as easily as they can bake and
keep house if they have to. If I keep you here
talking any longer to an old fellow like myself,
the boys won’t be responsible for their action.
You’re a novelty, you know, Piper’s glaring at
me.”</p>

<p>He rose leisurely, and went over beside Aunt
Win’s chair, and Piper Pearson hurried to take
his place.</p>

<p>“I thought he’d keep you talking here all
night. And you sat there drinking it all in as if
you liked it.”</p>

<p>“I did,” said Jean, flatly. “I loved it. I
haven’t been here at all. I’ve been way out on
the Kansas prairie.”</p>

<p>“Stuff,” said Piper calmly. “Say, got any
good dogs up at your place?”</p>

<p>“No, why?” Jean looked at him with sudden
curiosity.</p>

<p>“Nothing, only you remember when you were
moving from the Cove, Doris sold me her Boston
bull pup Jiggers?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know all about it.” As if she could
ever forget how they had all felt when Doris
parted with her dearest treasure and brought the
ten dollars in to add to the family fund.</p>

<p>“We’ve got some dandy puppies. I was wondering
whether you’d take one home to Doris
from me if I brought it in.”</p>

<p>“I’d love to,” said Jean, her face aglow. It
was just like a boy to think of that, and how
Doris would love it, one of Jiggers’ own family.
“I think we’ll call it Piper, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>Piper didn’t mind in the least. In fact, he
felt it would be a sign of remembrance, he said.
And he would bring in the puppy as soon as Jean
was ready to go home.</p>

<p>“But you needn’t hurry her,” Bab warned,
coming to sit with them. “She’s only been down
a week, and I’m hoping if I can just stretch it
along rather unconsciously, she’ll stay right
through the term, the way she should.”</p>

<p>Jean felt almost guilty, as her own heart
echoed the wish. How she would study, if only
it could happen. Yet there came the tug of
homesickness too, along the end of the second
week. Perhaps it was Kit’s letter that did it,
telling how the house was at sixes and sevens
without her, and Mother had to be in fifty places
at once.</p>

<p>Jean had to laugh over that part though, for
Kit was noted for her ability to attend to exactly
one thing at a time.</p>

<p>“Now, Shad, I can’t attend to more than one
thing at a time, you know.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you?” Shad had responded, meditatively.
“Miss Roxy can tend to sixty-nine and a
half things at the same time with her eyes shut
and one hand tied.”</p>

<p>Then suddenly, out of the blue sky came the
bolt. It was a telegram signed “Mother.”</p>

<p>“Come at once. Am leaving for California.”</p>

<p>Jean never stopped to think twice. It was
the call to duty, and she caught the noon train
back to Gilead Center.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span><h1>CHAPTER VIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>SEEKING HER GOAL</span></h1></div>

<p>All the way up on the train Jean kept thinking
about Daddy Higginson’s last words when he
had held her hand at parting.</p>

<p>“This isn’t my thought, Jeanie, but it’s a good
one even if Nietzsche did write it. As I used to
tell you in class about Pope and Socrates and all
the other warped geniuses, think of a man’s
physical suffering before you condemn what he
has written. Carlyle might have been our best
optimist if he’d only discovered pepsin tablets,
and lost his dyspepsia. Here it is, and I want
you to remember it, for it goes with arrows of
longing. The formula for happiness: ‘A yea,
a nay, a straight line, a goal.’ ”</p>

<p>It sounded simple enough. Jean felt all
keyed up to new endeavor from it, with a long
look ahead at her goal, and patience to wait for
it. She felt she could undertake anything, even
the care of the house during her mother’s absence,
and that was probably what lay behind the telegram.</p>

<p>When Kit met her at the station, she gave her
an odd look after she had kissed her.</p>

<p>“Lordy, but you do look Joan of Arc-ish,
Jean. You’d better not be lofty up home.
Everything’s at sixes and sevens.”</p>

<p>“I’m not a bit Joan of Arc-ish,” retorted Jean,
with a flash of true Robbins spirit. “What’s the
trouble?”</p>

<p>Kit gathered up the reins from Princess’s
glossy back, and started her up the hill. Mr.
Briggs had somehow been evaded this time.
There was a good coating of snow on the ground
and the pines looked weighed down by it, all
silver white in the sunshine, and green beneath.</p>

<p>“Nothing much, except that—what on earth
have you got in the bag, Jean?”</p>

<p>Jean had forgotten all about the puppy.
Piper had kept his word and met her at the train
with Jiggers’ son, a sleepy, diminutive Boston
bull pup all curled up comfortably in a wicker
basket with little windows, and a cosy nest inside.
He had started to show signs of personal
interest, scratching and whining as soon as Jean
had set the bag down at her feet in the carriage.</p>

<p>“It’s for Doris. Talbot Pearson sent it up
to her to remember Jiggers by.”</p>

<p>“Jiggers?”</p>

<p>“It’s Jiggers’ baby,” said Jean solemnly.
“Looks just like him, too. His name is Piper.
Won’t she love him, Kit?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” said Kit somewhat ungraciously.
“I haven’t room for one bit of sentiment
after the last few days. You’ve been
having a round of joy and you’re all rested up,
but if you’d been here, well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” eloquently.
“First of all there came a letter from Benita
Ranch. Uncle Hal’s not expected to live and
they’ve sent for Mother. Seems to me as if
everyone sends for Mother when anything’s the
matter.”</p>

<p>“But Father isn’t going way out there too, is
he?”</p>

<p>“Yes. They’ve wired money for both of them
to go, and stay for a month anyway, and Cousin
Roxy says it’s the right thing to do. She’s going
to send Mrs. Gorham, the Judge’s housekeeper,
to look after us. Now, Jean, don’t put up any
hurdles to jump over because it’s bad enough as
it is, and Mother feels terribly. She’d never
have gone if Cousin Roxy hadn’t bolstered up
her courage, but they say the trip will do Father
a world of good and he’ll miss the worst part of
the winter, and after all, we’re not babies.”</p>

<p>Jean was silent. It seemed as if the muscles
in her throat had all tightened up and she could
not say one word. They must do what was best,
she knew that. It had been driven into her head
for a year past, that always trying to do what
was best, but still it did seem as if California were
too far away for such a separation. The year
before, when it had been necessary to take Mr.
Robbins down to Florida, it had not seemed so
hard, because at Shady Cove they were well acquainted,
and surrounded by neighbors, but here—she
looked out over the bleak, wintry landscape
and shivered. It had been beautiful through the
summer and fall, but now it was barren and
cheerless. The memory of Bab’s cosy studio
apartment came back to her, and a quick sense
of rebellion followed against the fate that had
cast them all up there in the circle of those hills.</p>

<p>“You brace up now, Jean, and stop looking
as if you could chew tacks,” Kit exclaimed, encouragingly.
“We all feel badly enough and
we’ve got to make the best of it, and help
Mother.”</p>

<p>The next few days were filled with preparations
for the journey. Cousin Roxy came down
and took command, laughing them out of their
gloom, and making the Motherbird feel all would
be well.</p>

<p>“Laviny don’t hustle pretty much,” she said,
speaking of old Mrs. Gorham, who had been the
Judge’s housekeeper for years. “But she’s sure
and steady and a good cook, and I’ll drive over
every few days to see things are going along as
they should, and there’s the telephone too. Bless
my heart, if these big, healthy girls can’t look
after themselves for a month, they must be poor
spindling specimens of womanhood. I tell you,
Betty, it’s trials that temper the soul and body.
You trot right along and have a second honeymoon
in the land of flowers. And if it’s the
Lord’s will your brother should be taken, don’t
rebel and pine. I always wished we had the
same outlook as Bunyan did from his prison cell
when he wrote of the vision on Jordan’s bank,
when those left on this side sang and glorified
God if one was taken home. Remember what
Paul said, ‘For ye are not as those who have no
hope.’ Jean, put in your mother’s summer
parasol. She’s going to need it.”</p>

<p>Shad drove them down to the station in a
snowstorm. Jean stood in the doorway with
Cousin Roxy and Mrs. Gorham, waving until
they passed the turn of the road at the mill. The
other girls were at school, and the house seemed
fearfully lonely to her as she turned back and
fastened the storm doors.</p>

<p>“Now,” Cousin Roxy said briskly, drawing on
her thick knit woolen driving gloves, “I’m going
along myself, and do you stand up straight,
Jean Robbins, and take your mother’s place.”
She mitigated the seeming severity of the charge
by a sound kiss and a pat on the shoulder. “I
brought a ham down for you chicks, one of the
Judge’s prize hickory home smoked ones, and
there’s plenty in the cellar and the preserve
closet. You’d better let Laviny go along her
own gait. She always seems to make out better
that way. Just you have an oversight on the
girls and keep up the good cheer in the house.
Pile on the logs and shut out the cold. While
they’re away, if I were you I’d close up the big
front parlor, and move the piano out into the
living-room where you’ll get some good of it.
Goodbye for now. Tell Laviny not to forget
to set some sponge right away. I noticed you
were out of bread.”</p>

<p>Ella Lou took the wintry road with zest, the
steam clouding her nostrils, as she shook her head
with a snort, and breasted the hill road. Jean
breathed a sigh as the familiar carriage disappeared
over the brow of the hill. Out in the
dining-room, Mrs. Gorham was moving placidly
about as if she had always belonged there, humming
to herself an old time song.</p>

<p>When Shad returned from the station, he came
into the kitchen with a load of wood on his arm,
stamping his feet, and whistling.</p>

<p>“Seen anything of Joe?” he asked. “I ain’t
laid eyes on the little creature since breakfast,
and he was going to chop up my kindling for
me. I’ll bet a cookie he’s took to his heels. He’s
been acting funny for several days ever since
that peddler went along here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not really, Shad,” said Jean, anxiously.
She had overlooked Joe completely in the hurry
of preparations for departure. “What could
happen to him?”</p>

<p>“Nothing special,” answered Shad dryly,
“ ’cepting an ingrowing dislike for work.”</p>

<p>“You can’t expect a little fellow only nine to
work very hard, can you?”</p>

<p>“Well, he should earn his board and keep, I’ve
been telling him. And he don’t want to go to
school, he says. He’s got to do something. He
keeps asking me when I’m going down to Nantic.
Looks suspicious to me!”</p>

<p>“Nantic? Do you suppose—” Jean stopped
short. Shad failed to notice her hesitancy, but
went on out doors. Perhaps the boy was wondering
if he could get any trace of his father
down at Nantic, she thought. There was a great
deal of the Motherbird’s nature in her eldest
robin’s sympathy and swift, sure understanding
of another’s need. She kept an eye out for Joe
all day, but the afternoon passed, the girls came
home from school, and supper was on the table
without any sign of their Christmas waif. And
finally, when Shad came in from bedding down
the cows and milking, he said he was pretty sure
Joe had cut and run away.</p>

<p>“Do you think it’s because he didn’t want to
stay with us while Mother and Father were
away?” asked Helen.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” Shad replied. “I think he’s
just a little tramp, and he had to take to the road
when the call came to him. He wasn’t satisfied
with a good warm bed and plenty to eat.”</p>

<p>But Jean felt the responsibility of Joe’s loss,
and set a lamp burning all night in the sitting
room window as a sign to light his way back
home. It was such a long walk down through
the snow to Nantic, and when he got there, Mr.
Briggs would be sure to see him, and make
trouble for him. And perhaps he had wandered
out into the hills on a regular tramp and got
lost. Just before she went up to bed Jean called
up Cousin Roxy and asked her advice.</p>

<p>“Well, child, I’d go to bed tonight anyway.
He couldn’t have strayed away far, and there
are plenty of lights in the farmhouse windows to
guide him. I saw him sitting on the edge of the
woodpile just when your mother was getting
ready to leave, and then he slipped away. I
wouldn’t worry over him. It isn’t a cold night,
and the snow fall is light. If he has run off,
there’s lots of barns where he can curl down
under the hay and keep warm. When the Judge
drives down to Nantic tomorrow I’ll have him
inquire.”</p>

<p>But neither tomorrow, nor the day after, did
any news come to them of Joe. Mr. Briggs was
sure he hadn’t been around the station or the
freight trains. Saturday Kit and Doris drove
around through the wood roads, looking for footprints
or some other signs of him, and Jean telephoned
to all the points she could think of, giving
a description of him, and asking them to send
the wanderer back if they found him. But the
days passed, and it looked as if Joe had joined
the army of the great departed, as Cousin Roxy
said.</p>

<p>Before the first letter reached them from
California, telling of the safe arrival at Benita
Ranch of Mr. and Mrs. Robbins, winter decided
to come and stay a while. There came a morning
when Shad had hard work opening the storm
door of the kitchen, banked as it was with snow.
Inside, from the upper story windows, the girls
looked out, and found even the stone walls
and rail fences covered over with the great
mantle that had fallen steadily and silently
through the night. There was something majestically
beautiful in the sweep of the valley and
its encircling hills, seen in this garb.</p>

<p>“You’ll never get to school today, girls,” Mrs.
Gorham declared. “Couldn’t get through them
drifts for love nor money. ’Twouldn’t be
human, nuther, to take any horse out in such
weather. Like enough the mailman won’t pull
through. Looks real pretty, don’t it?”</p>

<p>“And, just think, Mother and Father are in
summerland,” Helen said, standing with her arm
around Jean at the south window. “I wish
winter wouldn’t come. I’m going to follow
summer all around the world some time when
I’m rich.”</p>

<p>“Helenita always looks forward to that happy
day when the princess shall come into her own,”
Kit sang out, gleefully. “Meantime, ladies, I
want to be the first to tell the joyous tidings.
The pump’s frozen up.”</p>

<p>“Shad’ll have to take a bucket and go down
to the spring then, and break through the ice,”
Mrs. Gorham said, comfortably. “After you’ve
lived up here all your life, you don’t mind such
little things. It’s natural for a pump to freeze
up this sort of weather.”</p>

<p>“You know,” Kit said darkly to Jean, a few
minutes later, in the safety of the sitting room,
“I’m not sure whether I want to be an optimist
or not. I think sometimes they’re perfectly
deadly, don’t you, Jean? I left my window
open at the bottom last night instead of the top,
and this morning, my dear child, there was snow
on my pillow. Yes, ma’am, and when I told
that to Mrs. Gorham, she told me it was good
and healthy for me, and I ought to have rubbed
some on my face. Let’s pile in a lot of wood
and get it nice and toasty if we do have to stay
in today. Who’s Shad calling to?”</p>

<p>Outside they heard Shad’s full toned voice
hailing somebody out in the drifts, and presently
Piney came to the door stamping her feet. She
wore a pair of Honey’s old “felts,” the high
winter boots of the men folks of Gilead, and was
muffled to her eyebrows.</p>

<p>“I walked over this far anyway,” she said
happily. “Couldn’t get through with the horse.
I wondered if we couldn’t get down to the mill,
and borrow Mr. Peckham’s heavy wood sled, and
try to go to school on that.”</p>

<p>“We can’t break through the roads,” objected
Doris.</p>

<p>“They’re working on them now. Didn’t you
hear the hunters come up in the night? The
barking of the dogs wakened us, and Mother
said there were four big teams going up to the
camp.”</p>

<p>Just then the door opened and Shad came in
with the morning’s milk, his face aglow, his
breath steaming.</p>

<p>“Well, it does beat all,” he exclaimed, taking
off his mittens and slapping his hands together.
“What do you suppose? It was dark last night
and snowing when I drove the cows up from the
barnyard. They was all huddled together like,
and I didn’t notice them. Well, this morning
I found a deer amongst ’em, fine and dandy as
could be, and he ain’t a bit scared, neither. Pert
and frisky and lying cuddled down in the hay
just as much at home as could be. Want to
come see him? I’ve got a path shoveled.”</p>

<p>Out they all trooped to the barn, through the
walls of snow. The air was still and surprisingly
mild. Some Phoebe birds fluttered about
the hen houses where Shad had dropped some
cracked corn, and Jim Dandy, the big Rhode
Island Red rooster, stood nonchalantly on one
foot eyeing the landscape as if he would have
said,</p>

<p>“Huh, think this a snowfall? You ought to
have seen one in my day.”</p>

<p>The barn smelled of closely packed hay and
dry clover. Inside it was dim and shadowy, and
two or three barn cats scooted away from their
pans of milk at the sight of intruders. Shad
led the way back of the cow stall to the calf
corner, and there, sure enough, shambling awkwardly
but fearlessly to its feet, was a big brown
deer, its wide brown eyes asking hospitality, its
nose raised inquiringly.</p>

<p>“You dear, you,” cried Doris, holding out her
hand. “Oh, if we could only tame him; and
maybe he’d bring a whole herd down to us.”</p>

<p>“Let’s keep him until the hunters have gone,
anyway,” Jean said. “Will he stay, Shad?”</p>

<p>“Guess so, if he’s fed, and the storm keeps up.
They often come down like this when feed’s
short, and herd in with the cattle, but this one’s
a dandy.”</p>

<p>“And the cows don’t seem to mind him one
bit.” Doris looked around curiously at the
three, Buttercup, Lady Goldtip and Brownie.
They munched their breakfast serenely, just as
if it were the most everyday occurrence in the
world to have this wild brother of the woodland
herd with them.</p>

<p>“Let’s call up Cousin Roxy and tell her about
it,” said Kit. “She’ll enjoy it too.”</p>

<p>On the way back to the house they stopped
short as the sharp crack of rifles sounded up
through the silent hills.</p>

<p>“They’re out pretty early,” said Shad, shaking
his head. “Them hunter fellows just love
a morning like this, when every track shows in
the snow.”</p>

<p>“They’d never come near here,” Doris exclaimed,
indignantly. “I’d love to see a lot of
giant rabbits and squirrels hunting them.”</p>

<p>“Would you, bless your old heart,” laughed
Jean, putting her arm around the tender hearted
youngest of the brood. “Never have any hunting
at all, would you?”</p>

<p>Doris shook her head.</p>

<p>“Some day there won’t be any,” she said,
firmly. “Don’t you know what it says in the
Bible about, ‘the lion shall lie down with the
lamb and there shall be no more bloodshed’?”</p>

<p>Shad looked at her with twinkling eyes as he
drawled in his slow, Yankee fashion,</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we even kill a chicken?”</p>

<p>And Doris, who specially liked wishbones,
subsided. Over the telephone Cousin Roxy
cheered them all up, first telling them the road
committeeman, Mr. Tucker Hicks, was working
his way down with helpers, and would get the
mailman through even if he was a couple of
hours late.</p>

<p>“You folks have a nice hot cup of coffee ready
for the men when they come along, and I’ll do
the same up here, to hearten them up a bit. I’ll
be down later on; a week from Monday is
Lincoln’s birthday, and I thought we’d better
have a little celebration in the town hall. It’s
high time we stirred Gilead up a bit. I never
could see what good it was dozing like a lot of
Rip van Winkles over the fires until the first
bluebird woke you up. I want you girls to all
help me out with the programme, so brush up
your wits.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that splendid?” exclaimed Kit, radiantly.
“Cousin Roxy is really a brick, girls.
She must have known we were ready to nip each
other’s heads off up here just from lack of occupation.”</p>

<p>Piney joined in the general laugh, and sat by
the table, eyeing the four girls rather wistfully.</p>

<p>“You don’t half appreciate the fun of being a
large family,” she said. “Just think if you were
the only girl, and the only boy was way out in
Saskatoon.”</p>

<p>Jean glanced up, a little slow tinge of color
rising in her cheeks. She had not thought of
Saskatoon or of Honey and Ralph for a long
while.</p>

<p>“When do you expect him back, Piney?”</p>

<p>“Along in the summer, I think. Ralph says
he is getting along first rate.”</p>

<p>“Give him our love,” chirped up Doris.</p>

<p>“Our very best wishes,” corrected Helen in
her particular way. But Kit said nothing, and
Jean did not seem to notice, so the message to
the West went unchallenged.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span><h1>CHAPTER IX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>JEAN MOTHERS THE BROOD</span></h1></div>

<p>Cousin Roxy came down the following day
and blocked out her plan for a celebration at the
Town Hall on Lincoln’s Birthday. The girls
had pictured the Town Hall when they had first
heard of it as a rather imposing edifice, imposing
at least, for Gilead. But it was really only
a long, old gray building, one story high, built
like a Quaker meeting house with two doors in
front, carriage houses behind, and huge century-old
elms overshadowing the driveway leading up
to it.</p>

<p>Two tall weather worn posts fronted the main
road, whereon at intervals were posted notices
of town meetings, taxes, and all sorts of “goings
on and doings,” as Cousin Roxy said. An
adventurous woodpecker had pecked quite a
good sized hole in the side of one post, and here
a slip of paper would often be tucked with an
order to the fishman to call at some out of the
way farmhouse, or the tea and coffee man from
way over near East Pomfret.</p>

<p>Next to the Town Hall stood the Methodist
Church with its little rambling burial ground
behind it, straying off down hill until it met a
fringe of junipers and a cranberry bog. There
were not many new tombstones, mostly old yellowed
marble ones, somewhat one sided, with
now and then a faded flag stuck in an urn where
a Civil War soldier lay buried.</p>

<p>“Antietam took the flower of our youth,”
Cousin Roxy would say, with old tender memories
softening the look in her gray eyes as she
gazed out over the old square plots. “The boys
didn’t know what they were facing. My mother
was left a young widow then. Land alive, do
you suppose there’d ever be war if women went
out to fight each other? I can’t imagine any fun
or excitement in shooting down my sisters, but
men folks are different. Give them a cause and
they’ll leave plough, home, and harrow for a
good fight with one another. And when Decoration
Day comes around, I always want to hang
my wreaths around the necks of the old fellows
who are still with us, Ezry, and Philly Weaver,
and old Mr. Peckham and the rest. And that
reminds me,” here her eyes twinkled. The girls
always knew a story was coming when they
looked that way, brimful of mirth. “I just met
Philly Weaver hobbling along the road after
some stray cows, ninety-two years young, and
scolding like forty because, as he said, ‘That boy,
Ezry Hicks, who only carried a drum through
the war, has dared ask for an increase in pension.’
Ezry must be seventy-four if he’s a day, but
he’s still a giddy boy drummer to Philly.”</p>

<p>Jean helped plan out the programme. It
seemed like old times back at the Cove where the
girls were always getting up some kind of entertainment
for the church or their own club. Billy
Peckham, who was a big boy over at Gayhead
school this year, would deliver the Gettysburg
speech, and the Judge could be relied on to give a
good one too. Then Jean hit on a plan. Shad
was lanky and tall, awkward and overgrown as
ever Abe Lincoln had been. Watching him out
of the dining-room window as he split wood, she
exclaimed suddenly,</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t we have a series of tableaux
on his early life, Cousin Roxy. Just look out
there at Shad. He’s the image of some of the
early pictures, and he never gets his hair cut before
spring, he says, just like the horses. Let’s
try him.”</p>

<p>Once they had started, it seemed easy. The
first scene could be the cabin in the clearing.
Jean would be Nancy Lincoln, the young
mother, seated by the fireplace, teaching her boy
his letters from the book at her knee.</p>

<p>“Dug Moffat will be right for that,” said Jean
happily. “He’s about six. Then we must show
the boy Lincoln at school. Out in Illinois, that
was, wasn’t it, Cousin Roxy, where he borrowed
some books from the teacher, and the rain soaked
the covers, so he split his first wood to earn
them.”</p>

<p>Cousin Roxy promised to hunt up all the
necessary historical data in the Judge’s library
at home, and they went after it in earnest.
Freddie Herrick, the groceryman’s boy over at
the Center, was chosen for Abe at this stage, and
Kit coaxed Mr. Ricketts, the mailcarrier, to be
the teacher.</p>

<p>“Go long now,” he exclaimed jocularly, when
she first proposed it. “I ain’t spoke a piece in
public since I was knee high to a grasshopper.
I used to spout, ‘Woodman, spare that tree.’
Yep. Say it right off smart as could be. Then
they had me learn ‘Old Ironsides.’ Ever hear
that one? Begins like this.” He waved one
arm oracularly in the air. “ ‘Aye, tear her tattered
ensign down, long has it waved on high.’
Once they got me started, they couldn’t stop me.
No, sirree. Went right ahead and learned ’em,
one after the other. ‘At midnight in his guarded
tent, the Turk lay dreaming of the hour—’
That was a Jim dandy to roll out. And—and
the second chapter of Matthew, and Patrick
Henry’s speech, and all sorts of sech stuff, but
I’d be shy as a rabbit if you put me up before
everybody now.”</p>

<p>Still, he finally consented, when Kit promised
him his schoolmaster desk could stand with its
back half to the audience to spare him from embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s coming on splendidly,” she cried to
Cousin Roxy, once she was sure of Mr. Ricketts.
“We’ll have Shad for the young soldier in the
Black Hawk war, and three of the big boys for
Indians. And then, let’s see, the courting of
Ann Rutledge. Let’s have Piney for Ann.
She has just that wide-eyed, old daguerreotype
look. Give her a round white turned down
collar and a cameo breast-pin, and she’ll be
ideal.”</p>

<p>The preparations went on enthusiastically.
Rehearsals were held partly at Greenacres,
partly over at the Judge’s, and always there
were refreshments afterwards. Mrs. Gorham
and Jean prepared coffee and cocoa, with cake,
but Cousin Roxy would send Ben down cellar
after apples and nuts, with a heaping dish of
hermits and doughnuts, and tall pitchers of
creamy milk.</p>

<p>Doris was very much excited over her part.
She was to be the little sister of the young soldier
condemned to death for falling asleep on sentinel
duty. And she felt it all, too, just as if it was,
as Shad said, ‘for real.’ Shad was the President
in this too, but disguised in a long old-fashioned
shawl of Cousin Roxy’s and the Judge’s tall hat,
and a short beard. He stood beside his desk,
ready to leave, when Doris came in and pleaded
for the boy who was to be shot at dawn.</p>

<p>“I know I’m going to cry real tears,” said
Doris tragically. “I can’t help but feel it all
right in here,” pressing her hand to her heart.</p>

<p>“Well, go ahead and cry for pity’s sake,”
laughed Cousin Roxy. “All the better, child.”</p>

<p>Kit had been chosen for a dialogue between
the North and the South. Helen, fair haired
and winsome, made a charming Southland girl,
very haughty and indignant, and Kit was a tall,
determined young Columbia, making peace between
her and the North, Sally Peckham.</p>

<p>It was Sally’s first appearance in public, and
she was greatly perturbed over it. Life down
at the mill had run in monotonous channels. It
was curious to be suddenly taken from it into
the limelight of publicity.</p>

<p>“All you have to do, Sally, is let down your
glorious hair like Rapunzel,” said Kit. “It’s
way down below your waist, and crinkles too,
and it’s like burnished gold.”</p>

<p>“It’s just plain everyday red,” said Sally.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t, and anyway, if you had read
history, you’d know all of the great and interesting
women had red hair. Cleopatra and Queen
Elizabeth and Theodora and a lot more. You’re
just right for the North because you look sturdy
and purposeful.”</p>

<p>“You know, Cousin Roxy, I think you ought
to be in this too,” said Jean, towards the last.</p>

<p>“I am,” responded Cousin Roxy, placidly.
“I’m getting up the supper afterwards. Out
here you always have to give them a supper, or
the men folks don’t think they’re getting their
money’s worth. Sometimes I have an oyster
supper and sometimes a bean supper, but this
time it’s going to be a chicken supper. And not
all top crust, neither. Plenty of chicken and
gravy. We’ll charge fifty cents admission. I
wish your father were here. He’d enjoy it.
Heard from them lately?”</p>

<p>Jean nodded, and reached for a letter out of
her work-basket on the table.</p>

<p>“Uncle Hal’s better, and Mother says—wait,
here it is.” She read the extract slowly.</p>

<p>“ ‘Next year Uncle Hal wants one of you girls
to come out and visit the ranch. I think Kit will
enjoy it most.’ ”</p>

<p>“So she would,” agreed Cousin Roxy.
“Don’t say when they expect to start for home,
does it? Or how your father is?”</p>

<p>“She only says she wishes she had us all out
there until spring.”</p>

<p>“Don’t write her anything that’s doleful.
Let her stay until she’s rested and got enough
of the sunshine and flowers. It will do her
good. We’ll let her stay until the first of March
if she likes.” Here Cousin Roxy put her arm
around Jean’s slender waist and drew her nearer.
“And then I want you should go up to visit Beth
for the spring. She’s expecting you. You’ve
looked after things real well, child.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I haven’t,” Jean said quickly.
“You don’t know how impatient I get with the
girls, especially Helen. It’s funny, Cousin
Roxy, but Doris and I always agree and pal
together, even do Helen’s share of the work for
her, and I think that’s horrid. We’re all together,
and Helen’s just as capable of helping
along as little Doris is.”</p>

<p>“Well, what ails her?” Cousin Roxy’s voice
was good natured and cheerful. “Found out
how pretty she is?”</p>

<p>“She found that out long ago,” Jean answered.
“She isn’t an ordinary person. She’s the Princess
Melisande one day, and Elaine the next.
It just seems as if she can’t get down to real
earth, that’s all, Cousin Roxy. She’s always
got her nose in a book, and she won’t see things
that just have to be done. And Kit tells me I’m
always finding fault, when I know I’m right.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, remember one thing. ‘Speak the
truth in love.’ Coax her out of it instead of
scolding. She’s only thirteen, you know, Jeanie,
and that’s a trying age. Let her dream awhile.
It passes soon enough, this ‘standing with reluctant
feet, where the brook and river meet.’ Remember
that? And it would be an awfully
funny world if we were all cut out with the same
cookie dip.”</p>

<p>So Helen had a respite from admonishings,
and Kit would eye her elder sister suspiciously,
noticing Jean’s sudden change of tactics. Two
of Helen’s daily duties were to feed the canary
and water the plants in the sunny bay window.
But half the time it was Kit who did it at the last
minute before they hurried away to school.
Then, too, Jean would notice Kit surreptitiously
attack Helen’s neglected pile of mending and
wade though it in her quick, easy-going way,
while Helen sat reading by the fire. But she
said nothing, and Kit grew uneasy.</p>

<p>“I’d much rather you’d splutter and say something,
Jean,” she said one day. “But you know
Helen helps me in her way. I can’t bear to
dust and she does all of my share on Saturday.
She opened up that box of books for Father from
Mr. Everden, and put them all away in his bookcase
in just the right order, and she’s been helping
me with my French like sixty. You know
back at the Cove she just simply ate up French
from Mother’s maid, Bettine, when she was so
little she could hardly speak English. So it’s
give and take with us, and if I’m satisfied, I don’t
think you ought to mind.”</p>

<p>“I don’t, not any more,” Jean replied, bending
over a neglected box of oil pastels happily.
“You do just as you want to, and I’m awfully
sorry I was catty about it. I guess the weather
up here’s got on my nerves, although Cousin
Roxy and Jean Robbins have cooked up something
between them, and that’s why she looks so
serene and calm.” She paused in the lower hall
and looked out of the little top glass in the door.
Around the bend of the road came Mr. Ricketts’
little white mail cart and old white horse with all
its daily promise of letters and papers. Kit was
out of the house, bareheaded, in a minute, running
to meet him.</p>

<p>“Got quite a lot this time,” he called to her
hopefully. “I couldn’t make out all of them, but
there’s one right from Californy and I guess
that’s what you’re looking for.”</p>

<p>Kit laughed and took back the precious load.
Magazines from Mrs. Crane, and newspapers
from the West. Post-cards for Lincoln’s birthday
from girl friends at the Cove, and one from
Piper with a picture of a disconsolate Boston bull
dog saying, “Nobody loves me.”</p>

<p>Jean opened the California letter first, with
the others hanging over the back of her chair.
It was not long, but Kit led in the cheer of
thanksgiving over its message.</p>

<p>“We expect to leave here about the 18th, and
should be in Gilead a week later.”</p>

<p>Doris climbed up on a chair to the calendar
next the lamp shelf, and counted off the days,
drawing a big circle around the day appointed.
But when they had called up Cousin Roxy and
told her, she squelched their hopes in the most
matter-of-fact way possible.</p>

<p>“All nonsense they coming back here just at
the winter break-up. I’ll write and tell them
to make it the first of March, and even then it’s
risky, coming right out of a warm climate. I
guess you girls can stand it another week or
two.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Kit heroically, “what can’t be
cured must be endured. Rub off that circle
around the 18th, Doris, and make it the first of
March. What’s that about the Ides of March?
Wasn’t some old fellow afraid of them?”</p>

<p>“Julius Cæsar,” answered Jean.</p>

<p>“No such a thing,” said Kit stoutly. “It was
Brutus or else Cassius. When they were having
their little set-to in the tent. We had it at school
last week. Girls, let’s immediately cast from us
the cares of this mortal coil, and make fudge.”</p>

<p>Jean started for the pantry after butter and
sugar, but in the passageway was a little window
looking out at the back of the driveway, and she
stopped short. Dodging out of sight behind a
pile of wood that was waiting to be split, was a
familiar figure. Without waiting to call the
girls, she slipped quietly around the house and
there, sure enough, backed up against the woodshed,
his nose fairly blue from the cold, was Joe.</p>

<p>“Don’t—don’t let Shad know I’m here,” he
said anxiously. “He’ll lick me fearfully if he
catches me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe,” Jean exclaimed happily. “Come
here this minute. Nobody’s going to touch you,
don’t you know that? Aren’t you hungry?”</p>

<p>Joe nodded mutely. He didn’t look one bit
ashamed; just eager and glad to be back home.
Jean put her arm around him, patting him as her
mother would have done, and leading him to the
kitchen. And down in the barn doorway stood
Shad, open mouthed and staring.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be honswoggled if that little creetur
ain’t come back home to roost,” he said to himself.
In the kitchen Joe was getting thawed out
and welcomed home. And finally the truth came
out.</p>

<p>“I went hunting my dad down around Norwich,”
he confessed.</p>

<p>“Did you find him?” cried Doris.</p>

<p>Joe nodded happily.</p>

<p>“Braced him up too. He says he won’t drink
any more ‘cause it’ll disgrace me. He’s gone to
work up there in the lockshop steady. He
wanted me to stay with him, but as soon as I
got him braced up, I came back here. You
didn’t get my letter, did you? I left it stuck in
the clock.”</p>

<p>Stuck in the clock? Jean looked up at the old
eight-day Seth Thomas on the kitchen mantel
that they had bought from old Mr. Weaver. It
was made of black walnut, with green vines
painted on it and morning glories rambling in
wreaths around its borders. She opened the
little glass door and felt inside. Sure enough,
tucked far back, there was Joe’s farewell letter,
put carefully where nobody would ever think of
finding it. Written laboriously in pencil it was,
and Jean read it aloud.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“Dere folks.</p>

</div>

<p>Joe looked around at them with his old confident
smile.</p>

<p>“See?” he said. “I told you I was coming
back.”</p>

<p>“And you’re going to stay too,” replied Jean,
thankfully. “I’m so glad you’re not under the
snow, Joe. You’d better run down and get in
that kindling for Shad.”</p>

<p>This took real pluck, but Joe rose bravely, and
went out, and Shad’s heart must have thawed a
little too, for he came in later whistling and said
the little skeezicks was doing well.</p>

<p>Jean laughed and sank back in the big red
rocker with happy weariness.</p>

<p>“And Bab said this country was monotonous,”
she exclaimed. “If anything else happens for a
day or so, I’m going to find a woodchuck hole
and crawl into it to rest up.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span><h1>CHAPTER X<br/> <span class='sub-head'>COUSIN ROXY’S “SOCIAL”</span></h1></div>

<p>The night of the entertainment down at the
Town Hall finally arrived. Doris said it was
one of the specially nice things about Gilead,
things really did happen if you just waited long
enough. There was not room enough for all the
family in the buggy or democrat with only one
horse, so the Judge sent Ben down to drive Mrs.
Gorham over and the two youngest. Shad took
the rest with Princess. All along the road they
met teams coming from various side roads, and
the occupants sent out friendly hails as they
passed. It was too dark to recognize faces, but
Kit seemed to know the voices.</p>

<p>“That’s Sally Peckham and her father,” she
said. “And Billy’s on the back seat with the
boys. I heard him laugh. There’s Abby
Tucker and her father. I hope her shoes won’t
pinch her the way they did at our lawn party
last year. And Astrid and Ingeborg from the
old Ames place on the hill. Hello, girls! And
that last one is Mr. Ricketts and his family.”</p>

<p>“Goodness, Kit,” Jean cried. “You’re getting
to be just like Cousin Roxy on family history.
I could never remember them all if I
lived out here a thousand years.”</p>

<p>“ ‘An I should live a thousand years, I ne’er
should forget it,’ ” chanted Kit, gaily. “Oh, I
do hope there’ll be music tonight. Cousin Roxy
says she’s tried to hire some splendid old fellow,
Cady Graves. Isn’t that a queer name for a
fiddler? He’s very peculiar, she says, but he
calls out wonderfully. He’s got his own burial
plot all picked out and his tombstone erected with
his name and date of birth on it, and all the decorations
he likes best. Cousin Roxy says it’s
square, and on one side he’s got his pet cow
sculptured with the record of milk it gave, and on
the other is his own face in bas relief.”</p>

<p>“It’s original anyway,” said Jean. “I suppose
there is a lot of satisfaction in fixing up
your own last resting place the way you want it
to be.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but after he’d sat for the bas relief, there
it was with a full beard, and now he’s clean
shaven, and Cousin Roxy says if he didn’t get
the stone cutter over to give the bas relief a shave
too.”</p>

<p>Down Huckleberry Hill they drove with all
its hollows and bumps and “thank-ye-ma’ams.”
These were the curved rises where the road ran
over a hidden culvert. Gilead Center lay in a
valley, a scattered lot of white houses set back
from the road in gardens with the little church,
country store and Town Hall in the middle of it.
The carriage sheds were already filled with teams,
so the horses were blanketed and left hitched outside
with a lot of others. Inside, the little hall
was filled with people, the boys perched up on
the windowsills where they could get a good view
of the long curtained-off platform that was used
as a stage.</p>

<p>Cousin Roxy was busy at her end of the room,
preparing the supper behind a partition, with
Mrs. Peckham and Mrs. Gorham to help.
Around the two great drum stoves clustered the
men and older boys, and the Judge seemed to
loom quite naturally above these as leader.
Savory odors came from the corner, and stray
tuning up sounds from another corner, where
Mr. Graves sat, the center of an admiring group
of youngsters. Flags were draped and crossed
over doorways and windows, and bunting festooned
over the top of the stage.</p>

<p>Jean took charge behind the curtain, getting
the children ready for their different parts in the
tableaux. Then she went down to the old tinkling,
yellow keyed piano and everybody stood up
to sing “My Country, ’Tis of Thee.”</p>

<p>“Land alive, it does grip the heartstrings,
doesn’t it?” Cousin Roxy exclaimed, once that
was over. “I often wish I’d done something in
my life to give folks a happy holiday every time
my birthday came ’round.”</p>

<p>Then the Judge rose and took the platform,
so tall that his head just missed the red, white and
blue bunting overhead. And he spoke of Lincoln
until it seemed as if even the smallest children
in the front rows must have seen and known him
too. Jean and Kit always enjoyed one of the
Judge’s speeches, not so much for what he said,
as for the pleasure of watching Cousin Roxy’s
face. She sat on the end of a seat towards the
back now, all in her favorite gray silk, her spectacles
half way down her nose, her face upraised
and smiling as she watched her sweetheart deliver
his speech.</p>

<p>“When you look at her you know what it
means in the Bible by people’s faces shining,
don’t you?” whispered Kit, as the Judge finished
in a pounding applause in which hands, feet and
chair legs all played their part.</p>

<p>Next came the tableaux amid much excitement
both before the curtain and behind. First of all
the curtain was an erratic and whimsical affair,
not to be relied on with a one-man power, so two
of the older boys volunteered to stand at either
end and assist it to rise and fall at the proper
time in case it should fail to respond to the efforts
of the official curtain raiser, Freddie Herrick.
But Fred’s mind was on the next ten minutes
when he was to portray the twelve-year-old
schoolboy Abe, and the crank failed to work, so
the curtain went up with the pulley lines instead,
and showed the interior of the little cabin with
Dug Moffat industriously learning to read at
Jean’s knee. And a very fair, young Nancy
she made too, with her dark hair arranged by
Cousin Roxy in puffs over her ears, and the plain
stuff gown with its white kerchief crossed in
front. On the wall were stretched ’possum and
squirrel pelts, and an old spinning wheel stood
beside the fireplace.</p>

<p>“You looked dear, Jean,” Helen whispered
when the curtain fell. “Your eyes were just like
Mother’s. Is my hair all right?”</p>

<p>Jean gave it a few last touches, and then hurried
to help with the music that went in between
the scenes. The school room scene was a great
success. Benches and an old desk made a good
showing, with some old maps hung around, and a
resurrected ancient globe of the Judge’s.</p>

<p>Mr. Ricketts appeared in all his glory, with
stock, skirted coat, and tight trousers. And
Fred, lean and lanky, his black forelock dangling
over his eyes as he bent over his books, made a
dandy schoolboy Lincoln. So they went on,
each picture showing some phase in the life of the
Liberator. But the hit of the evening was Doris
pleading for the life of her sentinel brother. She
had said she would surely cry real tears, and she
did. Kneeling beside the tall figure of the President,
her little old red fringed shawl around her,
she did look so woe begone and pathetic that
Cousin Roxy said softly,</p>

<p>“Land sakes, how the child does take it to
heart.”</p>

<p>Last of all came the tableau of the North and
South being reunited by Columbia, and Kit
looked very stern and judicial as she joined their
reluctant hands, and gave the South back her
red, white and blue banner.</p>

<p>It was all surprisingly good considering how
few things they had had to do with in the way
of properties and scenery, but Cousin Roxy
sprang a last surprise before the dancing began.
Up on the platform walked three old men, Philly
Weaver first, in his veteran suit, old Grandpa
Bide Tucker, Abby’s grandfather, and Ezra
Hicks, the “boy” of seventy. Solemn faced and
self conscious they took their places, and there
was the old Gilead fife and drum corps back
again.</p>

<p>“Oh, bless their dear old hearts,” cried Kit, her
eyes filled with sudden tears as the old hands
coaxed out “The Girl I Left Behind Me.”</p>

<p>There was hardly a dry eye in the Town Hall
by the time the trio had finished their medley of
war tunes. Many were there who could remember
far back when the little village band of boys
in blue had marched away with that same trio
at its head, young Bide and Ezra at the drums,
and Philly at the fife. When it was over and
the stoop-shouldered old fellows went back to
their benches, Cousin Roxy whispered to the
Judge, and he rose.</p>

<p>“Just one word more, friends and neighbors,”
he said. “Mrs. Ellis reminds me. A chicken
dinner will be served after the dancing.”</p>

<p>The floor was cleared for dancing now, and
Cady Graves took command. No words could
quite do justice to Cady’s manner at this point.
He was about sixty-four, a short, slender, active
little man, with a perpetual smile on his clean
shaven face, and a rolling cadence to his voice
that was really thrilling, Helen said.</p>

<p>It was the girls’ first experience at a country
dance. They sat around Cousin Roxy watching
the preparations, but not for long. Even Doris
found herself with Fred filling in to make up a
set. When the floor was full Cady walked
around like a ringmaster, critically surveying
them, and finally, toe up, heel down hard ready
to tap, fiddle and bow poised, he gave the word
of command.</p>

<p>“Sa-lute your partners!”</p>

<p>Jean thought she knew how to dance a plain
quadrille before that night, but by the time Cady
had finished his last ringing call, she was reduced
to a laughing automaton, swung at will by her
partner, tall young Andy Gallup, the doctor’s
son. Cady never remained on the platform.
He strolled back and forth among the couples,
sometimes dancing himself where he found them
slowing down, singing his “calling out” melodiously,
quaintly, throwing in all manner of interpolated
suggestions, smiling at them all like some
old-time master of the revels.</p>

<p>“Cousin Roxy, do you know he’s wonderful,”
said Kit, sitting down and fanning herself vigorously.</p>

<p>“Who? Cady?” Cousin Roxy laughed heartily.
She had stepped off with the Judge just as
lightly as the girls. “Well, he has got a way
with him, hasn’t he? Cady’s more than a person
up here. He’s an institution. I like to think
when he passes over the Lord will find a pleasant
place for him, he has given so much real happiness
to everyone.”</p>

<p>Last of all came the chicken supper, served at
long tables around the sides of the hall. All of
the girls were pressed into service as waitresses,
with Cousin Roxy presiding over the feast like a
beaming spirit of plenty.</p>

<p>“Land, do have some more, Mis’ Ricketts,”
she would say, bustling around behind the guests.
“Just a mite of white meat, plenty of it. Mr.
Weaver, do have some more gravy. I shall
think I missed making it right if you don’t.
There’s a nice drumstick, Dug.”</p>

<p>“Had two already, Mis’ Ellis,” Dug piped up
honestly.</p>

<p>“Well, they’re good for you. Eat two more
and maybe you’ll run like a squirrel, who knows,”
laughed Cousin Roxy.</p>

<p>“Kit,” Helen said once, as they rested a moment
near the little kitchen corner, “what a
good time we’re having, and think of the difference
between this and an entertainment at home.
Why is it?”</p>

<p>“Cousin Roxy,” answered Kit promptly.
“Put her down there and she’d bring people together
and make them have a good time just as
she does here. Doesn’t Jean look pretty tonight?
I don’t believe in praising the family, of
course, far be it from me,” she laughed, her eyes
watching Jean. “But I think my elder sister
in her Nancy get-up looks perfectly dear. She’s
growing up, Helenita.”</p>

<p>Helen nodded her head in the old wise fashion
she had, studying Jean’s appearance judicially.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t think she’ll ever be really
beautiful,” she said, gently, “but she’s got a
wonderful way with her like Mother. I heard
Cousin Beth tell Father she had charm. What
is charm, Kit?”</p>

<p>“Charm?” repeated Kit, thoughtfully. “I
don’t know exactly. But Jean and Mother and
Doris have it, and you and I, Helenita, have only
our looks.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span><h1>CHAPTER XI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>CYNTHY’S NEIGHBORS</span></h1></div>

<p>After the entertainment there followed a siege
of cold weather that pretty well “froze up everybody,”
as Shad said. A still coldness without
wind settled over the hills. No horses could
stand up on the icy roads. Mr. Ricketts was
held up with the mail cart for three days, and
when the road committee started out to remedy
matters, they got as far as Judge Ellis’s and
turned back. None of the girls could get to
school, so they made the best of it. Even the
telephone refused to respond to calls. On the
fourth day Mr. Peckham managed to break
through the roads with his big wood sled, and
riding on it was Sally muffled to the eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Unwind before you try to talk,” Kit exclaimed,
taking one end of the long knit muffler.
“How on earth did you get through?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t so bad,” Sally replied in her matter-of-fact
way, warming her hands over the kitchen
fire. “And our hill is fine for coasting. The
boys have been using it. Father’s going to break
the road through for the mail cart, and on his way
back we can all get on and ride back. You don’t
need any sleds. We’ve got a big bob.”</p>

<p>Jean and Helen hesitated. Winter at the
Cove had never meant this, but Doris pleaded
for them all to go, and Kit was frankly rebellious
against this spirit in the family.</p>

<p>“Jean Robbins,” she said, “do you really think
it is beneath your dignity to slide down hill on
a bobsled? You won’t meet one of Bab Crane’s
crowd. Come along.”</p>

<p>“It’s so cold,” Helen demurred, from her seat
by the sitting-room fire with a book to read as
usual.</p>

<p>“Cold? You’re a couple of cats, curled up by
the fire. Bundle up and let’s have some fun.”</p>

<p>“Do you all a pile of good,” Mrs. Gorham said
placidly. “You just sit around and toast yourselves
’stid of getting used to the cold. Get out
and stir around. Look at Sally’s red cheeks.”</p>

<p>So laughing together, they all wrapped up
warmly and went out to get on the wood sled
when it came back. The hill over by the sawmill
was not so steep, but it swept in long, undulating
sections, as it were, clear from the top of
Woodchuck Hill down to the bridge at Little
River. The Peckham boys had been sliding for
a couple of days, and had worn a fair sized track
over the snow and ice.</p>

<p>“There’ll be fine skating when the snow clears
off a bit,” Billy called out. “We’ve got a skating
club, and you’ll have to join. Piney’s the
best girl skater. Jiminy, you ought to see her
spin ahead. We skate on the river when it’s like
this and you can keep on going for miles.”</p>

<p>“Do you know, girls,” Jean said on the way
back, “I think we stay in the house too much
and coddle ourselves just as Mrs. Gorham says.
I feel simply dandy now. Who’s for the skating
club?”</p>

<p>Even Helen joined in. It seemed to take the
edge off the loneliness, this co-operation of outdoor
fun and sport. The end of the week found
the river clear and ready for skating. Jean
never forgot her first experience there. It was
not a straight river. It slipped unexpectedly
around bends and dipping hillsides, curving in
and out as if it played hide-and-seek with itself,
Doris said, like the sea serpent that met its own
tail half way around the seven seas.</p>

<p>Up near the Greenacre bridge Astrid and
Ingeborg met them with Hedda. Helen, the
fanciful, whispered to Jean how splendid it was
to have real daughters of the northland with
them, but Jean laughed at her.</p>

<p>“Cousin Roxy would say ‘fiddlesticks’ to that.
I’m sure they were all born right on this side of
the briny deep, you little romancer.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter where they were born,”
answered Helen, loftily. “They are the
daughters of vikings somewhere back. Just
look at their hair and eyes.”</p>

<p>It really was a good argument, Jean thought.
They had the bluest eyes and the most golden
hair she had ever seen. Sally skated up close to
her and began to talk.</p>

<p>“Father says when his father was a boy, there
were gray wolves used to come down in wintertime
from Massachusetts, and they’ve been
chased by them on this river when they were
skating.”</p>

<p>“My father tells of wolves too,” Astrid said in
her slow, wide-eyed way. “Back in Sweden.
He says he was in a camp in the forest on the
side of a great mountain, and the men told him
to watch the fires while they were hunting.
While he was there alone there came a pack of
wolves after the freshly killed game. He stood
with his back to the fire and threw blazing pine
knots at them to keep them back. While the fire
kept up they were afraid to come close, but he
could see the gleam of their eyes in the darkness
all around him, and hear them snap and snarl to
get at him. Then the men and dogs returned
and fought them. He was only thirteen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, and his name should have been Eric the
Bold, son of Sigfried, son of Leofric.” Kit
skated in circles around them, her muff up to her
face as she talked. “You’ve got such a dandy
name, Astrid, know it?”</p>

<p>“It is my grandmother’s name,” Astrid
answered in her grave unsmiling way.</p>

<p>“But it means a star, the same as Stella or
Estelle or Astarte or Ishtar. We’ve been studying
the meanings of proper names at school, and
it’s so fascinating. I wish I had been named
something like Astrid. I’d love to be Brunhilde.”</p>

<p>Jean watched them amusedly. Kit and Helen
had always been the two who had loved to make
believe they were “somebody else,” as Helen
called it. “Let’s play we’re somebody else,” had
been their unfailing slogan for diversion and variety,
but Jean lived in the world of reality. She
was Jean Robbins, living today, not Melisande
in an enchanted forest, nor Berengaria, not even
Kit’s favorite warrior maid, Jeanne D’Arc.
Helen could do up the supper dishes all by herself,
and forget the sordid details entirely making
believe she was the Lady of Tripoli waiting for
Rudel’s barque to appear, but Jean experienced
all of the deadly sameness in everyday life. She
could not sweep and dust a room and make believe
she was at the spring exhibitions. She
could not face a basket of inevitable mending,
and imagine herself in a castle garden clad in
clinging green velvet with stag hounds pacing at
her heels.</p>

<p>When they had first come to the country to
live, it had been comical, this difference in the
girls’ temperaments. Mrs. Robbins had wanted
a certain book in her room upstairs, after dark,
and had asked Helen to run up after it. And
Helen had hesitated, plainly distressed.</p>

<p>“For pity’s sake, Helenita, run along,” Jean
had said laughingly. “You’re not afraid of the
dark, are you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Helen had answered, doubtfully.
“Maybe I am. I’m the only one in the
family with imagination.”</p>

<p>Sometimes Jean almost envied the two their
complete self-absorption. She was never satisfied
with herself or her relation to her environment.
Seeing so many needs, she felt a certain
lack in herself when she shrank from the little
duties that crowded on her, and stole away her
time. She had brought up from New York a
fair supply of material for study, and had laid
out work ahead for the winter evenings, but the
days were slipping by, and time was short. Her
pads of drawing paper lay untouched in her desk
drawer. Not a single new pencil had been used,
not a stick of crayon touched. The memory of
Daddy Higginson driving his herd of cattle
cheered her more than anything when she felt
discouraged. And after all, when she thought of
the California trip and what a benefit it would
be to her father, that thought alone made her put
every regret from her, and face tomorrow
pluckily.</p>

<p>“I’m half frozen,” Doris said suddenly, just
as they swung around a bend of the river, and
faced long levels of snow-covered meadows.
“Oh, girls, look there.” She stopped short, the
rest halting too. Crossing over the frozen land
daintily, following a big antlered leader, were
five deer. Straight down to the river edge they
came, only three fields from the girls.</p>

<p>“They’ve got a path to their drinking place,”
said Sally. “Don’t move, any of you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wonder if ours is there,” Doris
whispered. “He hasn’t been with the cows since
the storm passed, but I know I could tell him
from the rest. He had a dark patch of brown
on his shoulder.”</p>

<p>“There’s only one with antlers,” Sally
answered. “I hope the hunters won’t find them.
I never could bear hunters. Maybe if we had
to depend on them for food it would be different,
but when they just come up here and kill for fun,
well, my mother says she just hopes some day it’ll
all come back to them good and plenty.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and who eats squirrel pie with the rest
of us,” her brother teased. “And partridge too.
She’s only talking.”</p>

<p>“Don’t fight,” Helen told them softly. “Isn’t
that a house over there where the smoke is?”</p>

<p>“It’s Cynthy Allan’s house,” Ingeborg looked
around warningly as she spoke the name. “I’m
not allowed to go there. She’s queer.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that interesting,” Kit cried. “I love
queer people. Let’s all go over and call on
Cynthy. How old is she, Ingeborg?”</p>

<p>“Oh, very old, over seventy. But she thinks
she is only about seventeen, and she’s always
doing flighty things. She’s lived out in the
woods all summer, and she ran away from her
family.”</p>

<p>“She won’t hurt you, I suppose,” Sally explained.
“Mother says she just worked herself
crazy. Once she started to make doughnuts and
they found her hanging them on nails all over
her kitchen, the round doughnuts, I mean. Lots
of them. So folks have been afraid of her ever
since.”</p>

<p>“Just because she made a lot of doughnuts and
hung them around her kitchen? I think that’s
lovely,” Kit cried. “What fun she must have
had. Maybe she just did it to nonplus people.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Sally said doubtfully. “She
took to the woods after that, and now she lives
in the house along with about fourteen cats.”</p>

<p>“I shall call on Cynthy today, won’t you,
Jean?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to get warmed up before we skate
back,” Jean agreed. “I don’t suppose she’d
mind. If you don’t want to, Ingeborg, you
could wait for us.”</p>

<p>Ingeborg thought waiting the wiser plan, but
the rest of them took off their skates, and started
up over the fields towards the little grey house in
the snow. There were bare rose bushes around
the front door and lilacs at the back. Several
cats scudded away at their approach and took
refuge in the woodshed, and at the side window
there appeared a face, a long, haggard, old face,
supported on one old, thin hand that incessantly
moved to hide the trembling of the lips. Kit, on
the impulse of the moment, waved to her, and
smiled.</p>

<p>“Gee, I hope she’s been cooking some of those
doughnuts today,” said one of the Peckham
boys.</p>

<p>Jean tapped at the door. It was several
minutes before it opened. Cynthy looked them
over first from the window before she took any
chances, and even when she did deign to lift her
latch, the door only opened a few inches.</p>

<p>“Could we please come in and get warm?”
asked Jean in her friendliest way.</p>

<p>“What did you stick out in the cold and get
all froze up for?” asked Cynthy tartly. But the
door opened wider, and they all trooped into the
kitchen. Out of every rush bottomed chair there
leaped a startled cat. The kitchen was poorly
furnished, only an old-fashioned painted dresser,
a wood stove, a maple table, and some chairs,
but the braided rugs on the floor made little oases
of comfort, and the fire crackled cheerfully,
throwing sparkles from the copper tea kettle.</p>

<p>“Ain’t had nobody to draw me no well water
today,” Cynthy remarked apologetically. “Else
I wouldn’t mind making you a cup of tea, such
as it is. Warm you up a mite anyhow.”</p>

<p>Steve Peckham grabbed the water pail and
hustled out to the well, and his brother made for
the woodshed to add to the scanty supply in the
woodbox.</p>

<p>“Ain’t had nobody to cut me no wood for a
spell nuther,” Cynthy acknowledged. “You
won’t find much out there ’ceptin’ birch and chips.
Sit right down close to the fire, girls.” She
looked them all over in a dazed but interested sort
of way. “Don’t suppose—” she hesitated, and
Kit flashed a telepathic glance at Jean. It
wasn’t possible Cynthy was still in the doughnut
making business, she thought. But the old lady
went on, “Don’t suppose you’d all like some of
my doughnuts, would ye? They’re real good
and tasty.”</p>

<p>Would they? They drew up around the old
maple table while Cynthy spread a red tablecloth
over it, and set out a big milkpan filled with
golden brown doughnuts. Jean found a chance
to say softly, she hoped Miss Allan would come
up to Greenacres soon, and sample some of their
cooking too.</p>

<p>“Ain’t got any hat to wear,” Cynthy answered
briefly. “Never go anywheres at all, never see
anybody. Might just as well be dead and buried.
Anyhow, it’s over two and a half miles to your
place, ain’t it? Used to be the old Trowbridge
place, only you put a fancy name on it, I heard
from the fishman. Don’t know what I’d do if it
wasn’t for him coming ’round once a week. I
never buy anything, but he likes to have a few
doughnuts, and I like to hear all the news. I’d
like to see how you’ve fixed up the old house.
When nobody lived there, I used to go down and
pick red raspberries. Fearful good ones over in
that side lot by the barn.”</p>

<p>“We made jam of them last year,” Kit exclaimed,
eagerly. “I’ll bring some down to you,
sure.”</p>

<p>“Wish I did have a hat to wear,” went on
Cynthy, irrelevantly. “Wish I had a hat with
a red rose on it. I had one once when I was a
girl, and it was so becoming to me. Wish I had
another just like it.”</p>

<p>“There’s a red silk rose at home among some
of Mother’s things. I know she’d love you to
have it. She’ll be home soon, and I’ll bring it
down to you when I find the rose.”</p>

<p>The very last thing that Cynthy called from
the door as they all trooped down the path, was
the injunction to Kit not to forget the rose.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it wonderful,” she said enthusiastically
to Jean, as they skated home. “She must be
seventy or eighty, Jean, but she longs for a red
rose. I don’t believe age amounts to a thing,
really and truly, except for wrinkles and rheumatism.
I’ll bet two cents when I’m as old as
Cynthy is, I’ll be hankering after pink satin
slippers and a breakfast cap with rosebuds.”</p>

<p>Jean laughed happily. The outing had
brought the bright color to her cheeks, and it
seemed as if she felt a premonition of good tidings
even before they reached the house up on
the pine-crowned hill. She was singing with
Doris as they turned in at the gateway and went
up the winding drive, but Kit’s eagle eye discovered
signs of fresh tracks in the snow.</p>

<p>“There’s been a team or a sleigh in here since
we went out,” she called back to them, and all at
once Doris gave an excited little squeal of joy,
and dashed ahead, waving to somebody who stood
at the side window, the big, sunny bay window
where the plant stand stood. Then Kit ran, and
after her Helen, and Jean too, all speeding along
the drive to the wide front steps and into the
spacious doors, where the Motherbird stood
waiting to clasp them in her arms.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span><h1>CHAPTER XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>FIRST AID TO PROVIDENCE</span></h1></div>

<p>It was after supper that night when the
younger ones were in bed that Jean had a chance
to talk alone with her mother, one of those intimate
heart to heart talks she dearly loved. Mr.
Robbins was so much improved in health that it
really seemed as if he were his old self once more.
The girls had hung around him all the evening,
delighted at the change for the better.</p>

<p>“It’s worth everything to see him looking so
well,” Helen had said in her grave, grown-up
way. “All the winter of trials and Mrs. Gorham,
and the pump breaking.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and to think,” Jean said to her mother,
as the girls made ready for the procession upstairs
to bed, “to think that Uncle Hal got well
too.”</p>

<p>“I think it was half an excuse to coax us west,
his illness,” laughed Mrs. Robbins, “and I told
him so. But, oh, my chicks, if you could only
see the ranch and live out there for a while. It
took me back so to my girlhood, the freedom and
sweep of it all. There is something about the
west and its mountains you never get out of your
system once you have known and loved them. I
want you all to go out there some day.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a pity that one of us isn’t a boy,” said
Kit meditatively. “Just because we are all girls,
we can’t go in for that sort of a life, and I’d love
it. At least for a little while. I’d like my life
to be a whole lot of experiences, one after the
other.”</p>

<p>“Piney says she’s going to live in the wilds anyway,
whether she’s a girl or not,” Helen put in,
leaning her chin on her palms on the edge of the
table, her feet up in the big old red rocker.
“She’s going to study forestry and be a government
expert, and maybe take up a big claim
herself. She says she’s bound she’ll live on a
mountain top.”</p>

<p>“Well, she can if she likes,” Jean said. “I like
Mother Nature’s cosy corners, don’t you,
Motherie? When you get up as high as you
can on any old mountain top, what’s the use?
You only realize how much you need wings.”</p>

<p>“Go on to bed, all of you,” ordered Kit, briskly.
“Jean, don’t you dare talk Mother to death
now.”</p>

<p>“Let me brush your hair,” coaxed Jean after
it was all quiet. So they sat downstairs together
in the quiet living-room, the fire burning low,
Mrs. Robbins in the low willow rocker, her long
brown hair unbound, falling in heavy ripples below
her waist. She looked almost girlish sitting
there in the half light, the folds of her pretty grey
crepe kimono close about her like a twilight cloud,
Jean thought, and the glow of the fire on her
face. Jean remembered that hour often in the
weeks that followed. After she had brushed out
her hair and braided it in soft, wide plaits, she
sat on the hassock at her feet and talked of the
trip west and all the things that had happened
at Greenacres during that time.</p>

<p>“One thing I really have learned, Mother
dear,” she finished. “Nothing is nearly as bad
as you expect it to be. It was very discouraging
when the pump was frozen, and Mrs. Gorham
got lonesome, but Cousin Roxy came down and
I declare, she seemed to thaw out everything.
We got a plumber up from Nantic, and Cousin
Roxy took Mrs. Gorham over to a meeting of
the Ladies’ Aid Society, and it was over in no
time.”</p>

<p>“Remember the old king who offered half of
his kingdom to whoever would give him a saying
that would always banish fear and care? And
the one that he chose was this, ‘This too shall pass
away.’ ”</p>

<p>“It’s comforting, isn’t it,” agreed Jean. “But
another thing, Mother, you know I’ve never been
very patient. I mean with little things. You’ll
never know how I longed to stay down in New
York with Bab this winter and go to art school.
I can tell you now, because it’s all over, and the
winter has done me good. But I was honestly
rebellious.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Robbins’ hand rested tenderly on the
smooth dark head beside her knee. Kit always
said that Jean’s head make her think of a nice,
sleek brown partridge’s crest, it was so smooth
and glossy.</p>

<p>“I know what you mean,” she said, this
Motherbird who somehow never failed to understand
the trials of her brood. “Responsibility is
one of the best gifts that life brings to us. I’ve
always evaded it myself, Jean, so I know the
fight you have had. You know how easy everything
was made for me before we came here to
live in these blessed old hills. There was always
plenty of money, plenty of servants. I never
worried one particle over the realities of life until
that day when Cousin Roxy taught me what it
meant to be a helpmate as well as a wife. So
you see, it was only this last year that I learned
the lesson which has come to you girls early in
life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know,” as Jean glanced up quickly to
object, “you’re not a child, but you seem just a
kiddie to me, Jean. It was fearfully hard for
me to give up our home at the Cove, and all the
little luxuries I had been accustomed to. Most
of all I dreaded the change for you girls, but
now, I know, it was the very best thing that could
have happened to us. Do you remember what
Cousin Roxy says she always puts into her
prayers? ‘Give me an understanding heart, O
Lord.’ I guess that is what we all lacked, and
me especially, an understanding heart.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t Cousin Roxy seem awfully well
acquainted with God, Motherie,” said Jean
thoughtfully. “I don’t mean that irreverently,
but it really is true. Why, I’ve been going to
our church for years and hearing the service over
and over until I know it all by heart, but when
she gets up at prayer meeting at the little white
church, it seems as if really and truly, He is there
in the midst of them.”</p>

<p>“She’s an angel in a gingham apron,” laughed
Mrs. Robbins. “Now, you must go to bed, dear.
It’s getting chilly. Did you see how glad Joe
was to have us back? Dear little fellow. I’m
glad he had the courage to come back to us. I
called up Roxy as soon as we arrived at the
station, and she will be over in the morning early
to plan about your trip to Weston.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but—you can’t spare me yet, can you?”
exclaimed Jean. “It’s still so cold, and I
wouldn’t be one bit happy thinking of you
managing alone here.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep Mrs. Gorham until you get back.
It’s only twelve a month for her, and that can
come out of my own little income, so we shall
manage all right. I want you to go, Jean.”
She held the slender figure close in her arms, her
cheek pressed to Jean’s, and added softly, “The
first to fly from the nest.”</p>

<p>Jean felt curiously uplifted and comforted
after that talk. It was cold in her own room
upstairs. She raised the curtain and looked out
at Greenacres flooded with winter moonlight.
They were surely Whiteacres tonight. It was
the very end of February and no sign of spring
yet. She knew over in Long Island the pussy
willow buds would be out and the air growing
mild from the salt sea breezes, but here in the
hills it was still bleak and frost bound.</p>

<p>What would it be like at Weston? Elliott
was away at a boys’ school. She felt as if Fate
were lending her to a fairy godmother for a while,
and she had liked Cousin Beth. There was
something about her,—a curious, indefinable,
intimate charm of personality that attracted one
to her. Cousin Roxy was breezy and courageous,
a very tower of strength, a Flying Victory standing
on one of Connecticut’s bare old hills and
defying fate or circumstance to ruffle her feathers,
but Cousin Beth was full of little happy chuckles
and confidences. Her merry eyes, with lids that
drooped at the outer corners, fairly invited you
to tell her anything you longed to, and in spite
of her forty odd years, she still seemed like a
girl.</p>

<p>Snuggled down under the big soft home-made
comforters, Jean fell asleep, still “cogitating” as
Cousin Roxy would have called it, on the immediate
future, wondering how she could turn
this visit into ultimate good for the whole family.
There was one disadvantage in being born a Robbins.
Your sympathies and destiny were linked
so indissolubly to all the other Robbinses that you
felt personally responsible for their happiness
and welfare. So Jean dozed away thinking how
with Cousin Beth’s help she would find a way of
making money so as to lighten the load at home
and give Kit a chance as the next one to fly.</p>

<p>The winter sunshine had barely clambered to
the crests of the hills the following morning when
Cousin Roxy drove up, with Ella Lou’s black
coat sparkling with frost.</p>

<p>“Thought I’d get an early start so I could sit
awhile with you,” she called breezily. “The
Judge had to go to court at Putnam. Real sad
case, too. Some of our home boys in trouble.
I told him not to dare send them up to any State
homes or reformatories, but to put them on probation
and make their families pay the fines.”</p>

<p>Kit was just getting into her school rig, ready
for her long drive down to catch the trolley car
to High School.</p>

<p>“Oh, what is it, Cousin Roxy?” she called from
the side entry. “Do tell us some exciting news.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it is pretty exciting for the poor
mothers.” Mrs. Ellis got out of the carriage
and hitched Ella Lou deftly, then came into the
house. “There’s been considerable things stolen
lately, just odds and ends of harness and bicycle
supplies from the store, and three hams from
Miss Bugbee’s cellar, and so on; a little here and
a little there, hardly no more’n a real smart magpie
could make away with. But the men folks
set out to catch whoever it might be, and if they
didn’t land three of our own home boys. It
makes every mother in town shiver.”</p>

<p>“None that we know, are there?” asked Helen,
with wide eyes.</p>

<p>“I guess not, unless it may be Abby Tucker’s
brother Martin. There his poor mother scrimped
and saved for weeks to buy him a wheel out of
her butter and egg money, and it just landed him
in mischief. Off he kited, first here and then
there with the two Lonergan boys from North
Center, and they had a camp up towards Cynthy
Allan’s place, where they played they were cave
robbers or something, just boy fashion. I had
the Judge up and promise he’d let them off
on probation. There isn’t one of them over
fifteen, and Gilead can’t afford to let her boys go
to prison. And I shall drive over this afternoon
and give their mothers some good advice.”</p>

<p>“Why not the fathers too?” asked Jean.
“Seems as if mothers get all the blame when boys
go wrong.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t that exactly.” Cousin Roxy put
her feet up on the nickel fender of the big wood
stove, and took off her wool lined Arctics,
loosened the wide brown veil she always wore tied
around her crocheted gray winter bonnet, and let
Doris take off her heavy shawl and gray and red
knit “hug-me-tight.” It was quite a task to get
her out of her winter cocoon. “I knew the two
fathers when they were youngsters too. Fred
Lonergan was as nice and obliging a lad as ever
you did see, but he always liked cider too well,
and that made him lax. I used to tell him when
he couldn’t get it any other way, he’d squeeze the
dried winter apples hanging still on the wild trees.
He’ll have to pay the money damage, but the real
sorrow of the heart will fall on Emily, his wife.
She used to be our minister’s daughter, and she
knows what’s right. And the Tucker boy never
did have any sense or his father before him, but
his mother’s the best quilter we’ve got. If I’d
been in her shoes I’d have put Philemon Tucker
right straight out of my house just as soon as he
began to squander and hang around the grocery
store swapping horse stories with men folks just
like him. It’s her house from her father, and I
shall put her right up to making Philemon walk
a chalk line after this, and do his duty as a
father.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you glorious peacemaker,” exclaimed
Mrs. Robbins, laughingly. “You ought to be
the selectwoman out here, Roxy.”</p>

<p>“Well,” smiled Cousin Roxy comfortably,
“The Judge is selectman, and that’s next best
thing. He always takes my advice. If the boys
don’t behave themselves now, I shall see that they
are squitched good and proper.”</p>

<p>“What’s ‘squitched,’ Cousin Roxy?” asked
Doris, anxiously.</p>

<p>“A good stiff birch laid on by a man’s hand.
I stand for moral persuasion up to a certain point,
but there does come a time when human nature
fairly begs to be straightened out, and there’s
nothing like a birch squitching to make a boy
mind his p’s and q’s.”</p>

<p>“Hurry, girls, you’ll be late for school,” called
the Motherbird, as she hurriedly put the last
touches to three dainty lunches. Then she followed
them out to the side door where Shad
waited with the team, and watched them out of
sight.</p>

<p>“Lovely morning,” said Cousin Roxy,
fervently. “Ice just beginning to melt a bit in
the road puddles, and little patches of brown
showing in the hollows under the hills. We’ll
have arbutus in six weeks.”</p>

<p>“And here I’ve been shivering ever since I got
out of bed,” Jean cried, laughingly. “It seemed
so bleak and cheerless. You find something
beautiful in everything, Cousin Roxy.”</p>

<p>“Well, Happiness is a sort of habit, I guess,
Jeanie. Come tell me, now, how are you fixed
about going away? That’s why I came down.”</p>

<p>“You mean—”</p>

<p>“I mean in clothes. Don’t mind my speaking
right out, because I know that Bethiah will want
to trot you around, and you must look right.
And don’t you say one word against it, Elizabeth,”
as Mrs. Robbins started to speak. “Your
trip out west has been an expense, and the child
must have her chance. Makes me think, Jean,
of my first silk dress. Nobody knew how much
I wanted one, and I was about fourteen, skinny
and overgrown, with pigtails down my back.
Cousin Beth’s mother, our well-to-do aunt in
Boston, sent a silk dress to my little sister Susan
who died. I can see it now, just as plain as can
be, a sort of dark bottle green with a little spray
of violets here and there. Susan was sort of
pining anyway, and green made her look too pale,
so the dress was set aside for me. Mother said
she’d let the hem down and face it when she had
time but there was a picnic, and my heart
hungered for that silk dress to wear. I managed
somehow to squeeze into it, and slip away with
the other girls before Mother noticed me.”</p>

<p>“But did it fit you?” asked Jean.</p>

<p>“Fit me?” Cousin Roxy laughed heartily.
“Fit me like an acorn cap would a bullfrog. I
let the hem down as far as I could, but didn’t
stop to hem it or face it, and there it hung, six
inches below my petticoats, with the sun shining
through as nice as could be. My Sunday School
teacher took me to one side and said severely,
‘Roxana Letitia Robbins, does your mother
know that you’ve let that hem down six ways for
Sunday?’ Well, it did take away my hankering
for a silk dress. Now, run along upstairs and
get out all your wardrobe so we can look it over.”</p>

<p>Jean obeyed. Somehow Cousin Roxy had a
way of sweeping objections away before her
airily. And the wardrobe was at a low ebb,
when it came to recent styles. In Gilead Center,
anything later than the time of the mutton leg
sleeve was regarded as just a bit too previous,
as Deacon Farley’s wife said when Cousin Roxy
laid away her great aunt’s Paisley shawl after
she married the Judge.</p>

<p>She dragged her rocking chair over beside the
sofa now, and took inventory of the pile of clothing
Jean laid there.</p>

<p>“You’ll want a good knockabout sport coat
like the other girls are wearing, and a pretty mid-season
hat to match. Then a real girlish sort of
a silk sweater for the warm spring days that are
coming, and a good skirt for mornings. Bethiah
likes to play tennis, and she’ll have you out at
daybreak. Better get a pleated blue serge.
Now, what about party gowns?”</p>

<p>Here Jean felt quite proud as she laid out her
assortment. The girls had always gone out a
good deal at the Cove, and she had a number of
well chosen, expensive dresses.</p>

<p>“They look all right to me, but I guess
Bethiah’ll know what to do to them, with a touch
here and there. Real lace on them, oh, Elizabeth!”
She shook her head reprovingly at Mrs.
Robbins, just sitting down with a pan of apples
to pare.</p>

<p>“I’d rather go without than not have the real,”
Jean said quickly, trying to spare the Motherbird’s
feelings, but Gilead had indeed been a balm
to pride. She laughed happily.</p>

<p>“I know, Roxy, it was foolish. But see how
handy it comes in now. We’ve hardly had to
buy any new clothes since we moved out here,
and the girls have done wonderfully well making
over their old dresses.”</p>

<p>“Especially Helen,” Jean put in. “Helen
would garb us all in faded velvets and silks,
princesses wearing out their old court robes in
exile.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I were you, I’d just bundle all I
wanted to take along in the way of pretty things
into the trunk and let Bethiah tell you what to
do with them. She knows just what’s what in
the latest styles, and you’ll be like a lily of the
field. I’ll get you the coat and sweater and
serge skirt, and all the shoes and stockings you’ll
need to match. Go long, child, you’ll squeeze
the breath out of me,” as Jean gave her a royal
hug. “I must be trotting along.” She rose, and
started to bundle up, but gave an exclamation as
she glanced out of the window. “For pity’s sake,
what’s Cynthy Allan doing way off up here?”</p>

<p>Sure enough, hobbling along from the garden
gate was Cynthy herself, one hand holding fast
to an old cane, the other drawing around her frail
figure an old-fashioned black silk dolman, its
knotted fringe fluttering in the breeze.</p>

<p>Straight up the walk she came, determined and
self possessed, with a certain air of dignity which
neither poverty nor years of isolation could take
from her.</p>

<p>Cousin Roxy watched her with reminiscent
eyes, quoting softly:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';fs:0.9em;' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>“You may break, you may shatter the vase if you will,</p>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>&ensp;But the scent of the roses will hang round it still.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p>“Cynthy used to be the best dancer of all the
girls when I was young, and I’ll never forget how
the rest of us envied her beautiful hands. She
was an old maid even then, in the thirties, but
slim and pretty as could be.”</p>

<p>Jean hurried to the side door, opening it wide
to greet her.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think you’d mind my coming so
early,” she said apologetically, “but I’ve had that
rose on my mind ever since you were all over to
see me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do come right in, Miss Allan,” Jean exclaimed
warmly. “What a long, long walk
you’ve had.”</p>

<p>“ ’Tain’t but two miles and a half by the road,”
Cynthy answered as sprightly as could be. “I
don’t mind it much when I’ve got something
ahead of me. You see, I’ve been wanting to ride
up to Moosup this long while to get some rags
woven into carpets and I need that rose for my
hat something fearful.”</p>

<p>Jean led her through the long side entry way
and into the cheery warm sitting room before she
hardly realized where she was going, until she
found herself facing Cousin Roxy and Mrs.
Robbins.</p>

<p>“Land alive, Cynthy,” exclaimed the former,
happily. “I haven’t seen you in mercy knows
when. Where are you keeping yourself?”</p>

<p>“Take the low willow rocker, Miss Allan,”
urged Mrs. Robbins after the introduction was
over, and she had helped lift the ancient dolman
from Cynthy’s worn shoulders. Jean was
hovering over the rocker delightedly. As she
told the girls afterwards, Mother was just as dear
and charming as if Cynthy had been the president
of the Social Study Club back home.</p>

<p>“Thank ye kindly,” said Cynthy with a little
sigh of relief. She stretched out her hands to
the fire, looking from one to the other of them
with a mingling of pride and appeal. Those
scrawny hands with their knotted knuckles and
large veins. Jean thought of what Cousin Roxy
had said, that Cynthy’s hands had been so beautiful.
She ran upstairs to find the rose. It was
in a big cretonne covered “catch-all” box, tucked
away with odds and ends of silks and laces, a
large hand-made French rose of silk and velvet,
its petals shaded delicately from palest pink at
the heart to deep crimson at the outer rim.
There was a black lace veil in the box too that
seemed to go with it, so Jean took them both back
downstairs, and Cynthy’s face was a study as she
looked at them. She rocked to and fro gently,
a smile of perfect content on her face, her head
a bit on one side.</p>

<p>“Ain’t it sightly, Roxy?” she said. “And
those shades always did become me so. I suppose
it’s foolish of me, but I just needed that
rose to hearten me up for the trip to Moosup. I
had a letter from the town clerk.” She fumbled
in the folds of her skirt for it. “He says I
haven’t paid my taxes in over two years, and the
town can’t let them go on any longer, and anyhow,
he thinks it would be better for me to let
the house and six acres be sold for the taxes, and
for me to go down to the town farm. My heart’s
nigh broken over it.”</p>

<p>Cousin Roxy was sitting very straight in her
chair, her shoulders squared in fighting trim, her
eyes bright as a squirrel’s behind her spectacles.</p>

<p>“What do you calculate to do about it,
Cynthy?”</p>

<p>“Well, I had a lot of good rag rugs saved up,
and I thought mebbe I could sell them for something,
and some more rags ready for weaving,
and there’s some real fine old china that belonged
to old Aunt Deborah Bristow, willow pattern
and Rose Windsor, and the two creamer sets in
copper glaze and silver gilt. I’ll have to sell the
whole lot, most likely. It’s twenty-four dollars.”</p>

<p>Jean was busily sewing the rose in place on the
old black bonnet and draping the lace veil over
it. Mrs. Robbins’ eyes flashed a signal to Cousin
Roxy and the latter caught it.</p>

<p>“Cynthy,” she said briskly, “you get all
warmed up and rested here, and I’ll drive down
and see Fred Bennet. He’s the other selectman
with the Judge, and I guess between them, we
can stop any such goings on. It isn’t going to
cost the town any for your board and keep, anybody
that’s been as good a neighbor as you have
in your day, helping folks right and left. I
shan’t have it. Which would you rather do, stay
on at your own place, or come over to me for a
spell? I’ll keep you busy sewing on my carpet
rags, and we’ll talk over old times. I was just
telling Mrs. Robbins and Jean what a lovely
dancer you used to be, and what pretty hands
you had.”</p>

<p>Cynthy’s faded hazel eyes blinked wistfully
behind her steel rimmed “specs.” Her hand
went up to hide the trembling of her lips, but
before she could answer, the tears came freely,
and she rocked herself to and fro, with Jean
kneeling beside her petting her, and Mrs. Robbins
hurrying for a hot cup of tea.</p>

<p>“I’d rather stay at my own place, Roxy,” she
said finally, when she could speak. “It’s home,
and there’s all the cats to keep me company. If
I could stay on down there, and see some of you
now and then, I’d rather, only,” she looked up
pleadingly, “could I just drive over with you
today, so as to have a chance to wear the red
rose?”</p>

<p>Could she? The very desire appealed instantly
to Cousin Roxy’s sense of the fitness of
things, and she drove away finally with Cynthy.
It was hard to say which looked the proudest.</p>

<p>“Mother darling,” Jean said solemnly, watching
them from the window. “Isn’t that a wonderful
thing?”</p>

<p>“What, dear? Roxy’s everlasting helping of
Providence? I’ve grown so accustomed to it
now that nothing she undertakes surprises me.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t mean that.” Jean’s eyes
sparkled as if she had discovered the jewel of
philosophy. “I mean that poor old woman over
seventy being able to take happiness and pride
out of that red rose, when life looked all hopeless
to her. That’s eternal youth, Mother mine, isn’t
it? To think that old rose could bring such a
look to her eyes.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t so much the rose that drew her
here,” said the Motherbird, gazing out of the
window at the winding hill road Ella Lou had
just travelled. “It was the lure of human companionship
and neighborliness. We’ll let Doris
and Helen take her some preserves tomorrow,
and try and cheer her up with little visits down
there. How Cousin Roxy will enjoy facing the
town clerk and showing him the right way to
settle things without breaking people’s hearts.
There comes the mail, dear. Have you any to
send out?”</p>

<p>Jean caught up a box of lichens and ferns she
had gathered for Bab, and hurried out to the
box. It stood down at the entrance gates, quite
a good walk on a cold day, and her cheeks were
glowing when she met Mr. Ricketts.</p>

<p>“Two letters for you, Miss Robbins,” he called
out cheerfully. “One from New York, and
one,” he turned it over to be sure, “from Boston.
Didn’t know you had any folks up Boston way.
Got another one here for your father looks interesting
and unusual. From Canady. I suppose,
come to think of it, that might be from
Ralph McRae or maybe Honey Hancock, eh?”</p>

<p>Jean took the letters, and tried to divert him
from an examination of the mail, his daily
pastime.</p>

<p>“It looks as if we might have a thaw, doesn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Does so,” he replied, reassuringly, “but we’ll
get a hard spell of weather along in March, as
usual. Tell your Pa if he don’t want to save
them New York Sunday papers, I’d like to have
a good look at them. Couldn’t see anything but
some of the headlines, they was done up so tight.
Go ’long there, Alexander.”</p>

<p>Alexander, the old white horse, picked up his
hoofs and trotted leisurely down the hill to the
little bridge, with his usual air of resigned nonchalance,
while Jean ran back with the unusual
and interesting mail, laughing as she went.
Still, as Cousin Roxy said, it was something to
feel you were adding to local history by being a
part and parcel of Mr. Ricketts’ mail route.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MOUNTED ON PEGASUS</span></h1></div>

<p>It was one of the habits and customs of Greenacres
to open the daily mail up in Mr. Robbins’
own special room, the big sunny study overlooking
the outer world so widely.</p>

<p>When they had first planned the rooms, it had
been decided that the large south chamber should
be Father’s own special corner. From its four
windows he could look down on the little bridge
and brown rock dam above with its plunging
waterfall, and beyond that the widespread lake,
dotted with islands, reed and alder fringed, that
narrowed again into Little River farther on.</p>

<p>“It’s queer,” Doris said once, when winter was
half over. “Nothing ever really looks dead up
here. Even with the grass and leaves all dried
up, the trees and earth look kind of reddish, you
know what I mean, Mother, warm like.”</p>

<p>And they did too, whether it was from the rich
russets of the oaks that refused to leave their
twigs until spring, or the green laurel underneath,
or the rich pines above, or the sorrel tinted
earth itself, the land never seemed to lose its
ruddy glow except when mantled with snow.</p>

<p>Mr. Robbins stood at a window now, his hands
behind his back, looking out at the valley as they
came upstairs.</p>

<p>“Do you know, dear,” he remarked. “I think
I just saw some wild geese over on that first
island, probably resting for the trip north overnight.
That means an early spring. And there
was a woodpecker on the maple tree this morning
too. That is all my news. What have you
brought?”</p>

<p>Everyone settled down to personal enjoyment
of the mail. There was always plenty of it, letters,
papers, new catalogues, and magazines, and
it furnished the main diversion of the day.</p>

<p>Jean read hers over, seated in the wide window
nook. Bab’s letter was full of the usual studio
gossip, and begging her to come for a visit at
Easter. But Cousin Beth’s letter was brimful
of the coming trip. She wrote she would meet
Jean in Boston, and they would motor over if
the roads were good.</p>

<p>“Plan on staying at least two months, for it
will be work as well as play. I was afraid you
might be lonely with just us, so I have invited
Carlota to spend her week ends here. You will
like her, I am sure. She is a young girl we met
last year in Sorrento. Her father is an American
sculptor and married a really lovely Contessa.
They are deep in the war relief work now, and
have sent Carlota over here to study and learn
the ways of her father’s country. She is staying
with her aunt, the Contessa di Tambolini, the
oddest, dearest, little old grande dame you can
imagine. You want to call her the Countess
Tambourine all the time, she tinkles so. It just
suits her, she is so gay and whimsical and brilliant.
Come soon, and don’t bother about buying
a lot of new clothes. I warn you that you will be
in a paint smock most of the time.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what her other name is,” Jean said,
folding up the letter. “One of our teachers at
the Art Class in New York was telling us her
memories of Italy, and she mentioned some
American sculptor who had married an Italian
countess and lived in a wonderful old villa, at
Sorrento, of a dull warm tan color, with terraces
and rose gardens and fountains, and nice crumbly
stone seats. She went to several of his receptions.
Wouldn’t it be odd if he turned out to be
Carlota’s father. It’s such a little world, isn’t
it, Father?”</p>

<p>“We live in circles, dear,” Mr. Robbins smiled
over the wide library table at her flushed eager
face. “Little eddies of congeniality where we
are constantly finding others with the same tastes
and ways of living. Here’s a letter from Ralph,
saying they will start east in May, and stay along
through the summer, taking Mrs. Hancock and
Piney back with them.”</p>

<p>“Piney’ll simply adore the trip way out west,”
exclaimed Jean. “She’s hardly talked of anything
else all winter but his promise to take them
there, and Mrs. Hancock’s just the opposite.
She declares her heart is buried right up in the
little grave yard behind the church in the Hancock
and Trowbridge plot.”</p>

<p>“She’ll go as long as both children are happy,”
Mrs. Robbins said. “She has an odd little vein
of sentiment in her that makes her cling to the
land she knows best and to shrink from the unknown
and untried, but I’m sure she’ll go. She’s
such a quiet, retiring little country mother to
have two wild swans like Honey and Piney, who
are regular adventurers. I’ll drive over and
have a talk with her as soon as my own bird of
passage is on her way.”</p>

<p>Wednesday of the following week was set for
Jean’s flitting. This gave nearly a week for
preparations, and Kit plunged into them with a
zest and vigor that made Jean laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, so little ever happens up here we just
have to make the most of goings and comings,”
said Kit, warmly. “And besides, I’m rather
fond of you, you blessed, skinny old dear, you.”</p>

<p>“Of course, we’re all glad for you,” Helen put
in in her serious way. “It’s an opportunity,
Mother says, and I suppose we’ll all get one in
time.”</p>

<p>Jean glanced up as they sat around the table
the last evening, planning and talking. Out in
the side entry stood her trunk, packed, locked,
and strapped, ready for the early trip in the
morning. Doris was trying her best to nurse a
frost bitten chicken back to life out by the kitchen
stove, where Joe mended her skates for her, but
Kit and Helen were freely bestowing advice on
the departing one.</p>

<p>“Enjoy yourself all you can, but think of us
left at home and don’t stay too long,” advised
Helen. “I feel like the second mermaid.”</p>

<p>“What on earth do you mean by the second
mermaid?” asked Kit.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see? I’m not the youngest, so I’m
second from the youngest, and in ‘The Little
Mermaid’ there were sixteen sisters and each had
to wait her turn till her fifteenth birthday before
she could go up to the surface of the sea, and sit
on a rock in the moonlight.”</p>

<p>“Pretty chilly this kind of weather,” Jean
laughed. “Can’t I wear a sealskin wrapped
around me, please, Helenita?”</p>

<p>“No, she only had seaweed draperies and necklaces
of pearls,” Helen answered, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I shall remember,” Jean declared. “I’d love
to use that idea as a basis for a gown some time,
seaweed green trailing silk, and long strands of
pearls. If I fail as an artist, I shall devote myself
to designing wonderful personality gowns
for people, not everyday people, but exceptional
ones. Think, Kit, of having some great singer
come to your studio, and you listen to her warble
for hours, while you lie on a stately divan and
try to catch her personality note for a gown.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to make things for people,” Kit
said, emphatically. “I want to soar alone. I’m
going with Piney to live in the dreary wood, like
the Robber Baron. I’ll wear leather clothes. I
love them. I’ve always wanted a whole dress of
softest suede in dull hunter’s green. No fringe
or beads, just a dress. It could lace up one side,
and be so handy.”</p>

<p>“Specially if a grasshopper got down your
neck,” Doris added sagely. “I can just see Kit
all alone in the woods then.”</p>

<p>They laughed at the voice from the kitchen,
and Kit dropped the narrow silk sport tie she
was putting the finishing stitches to.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, I do envy you, Jean, after all.
You must write and tell us every blessed thing
that happens, for we’ll love to hear it all. Don’t
be afraid it won’t be interesting. I wish you’d
even keep a diary. Shad says his grandmother
did, every day from the time she was
fourteen, and she was eighty-six when she died.
They had an awful time burning them all up,
just barrels of diaries, Shad says. All the history
of Gilead.”</p>

<p>Kit’s tone held a note of pathos that was
delicious.</p>

<p>“Who cares about what’s happened in Gilead
every day for seventy years?” Helen’s query was
scoffing, but Jean said,</p>

<p>“Listen. Somebody, I forget who, that
Father was telling about, said if the poorest,
commonest human being who ever lived could
write a perfect account of his daily life, it would
be the most wonderful and interesting human
document ever written.”</p>

<p>Helen’s expression showed plainly that she did
not believe one bit in “sech sentiments,” as Shad
himself might have put it. Life was an undiscovered
country of enchantment to her where the
sunlight of romance made everything rose and
gold. She had always been the most detached
one in the family. Only Kit with her straightforward,
uncompromising tactics ever seemed to
really get by the thicket of thorns around the
inner palace of the sleeping beauty. Kit had
been blessed with so much of her father’s New
England directness and sense of humor, that no
thorns could hold her out, while Doris and Jean
were more like their mother, tender-hearted and
keenly responsive to every influence around them.</p>

<p>“I don’t see,” Kit would say sometimes, “which
side of the family Helen gets her ways from. I
suppose if we could only trace back far enough,
we’d find some princess ancestress who trailed
her velvet gowns lightsomely over the morning
dew and rode a snow white palfrey down forest
glades for heavy exercise. Fair Yoland with the
Golden Hair.”</p>

<p>“Anyway,” Helen said now, hanging over
Jean’s chair, “be sure and write us all about
Carlota and the Contessa, because they sound
like a story.”</p>

<p>Doris came out of the kitchen with her finger
to her lips.</p>

<p>“I’ve just this minute got that chicken to sleep.
They’re such light sleepers, but I think it will
get well. It only had its poor toes frost bitten.
Joe found it on the ground this morning, crowded
off the perch. Chickens look so civilized, and
they’re not a bit. They’re regular savages.”</p>

<p>She sat down on the arm of Jean’s chair, and
hugged the other side, with Helen opposite.
And there flashed across Jean’s mind the picture
of the evenings ahead without the home circle,
without the familiar living-room, and the other
room upstairs where at this time the Motherbird
would be brushing out her long, soft hair, and
listening to some choice bit of reading Mr. Robbins
had run across during the day and saved for
her.</p>

<p>“I just wish I had a chance to go west like
Piney,” Kit said suddenly. “When I’m old
enough, I’m going to take up a homestead claim
and live on it with a wonderful horse and some
dogs, wolf dogs, I think. I wish Piney’d wait
till we were both old enough, and had finished
school. She could be a forest ranger and I’d
raise—”</p>

<p>“Ginseng,” Jean suggested, mischievously.
“Goose. It takes far more courage than that
just to stick it out on one of these old barren
farms, all run down and fairly begging for somebody
to take them in hand and love them back to
beauty. What do you want to hunt a western
claim for?”</p>

<p>“Space,” Kit answered grandly. “I don’t
want to see my neighbors’ chimney pots sticking
up all around me through the trees. I want to
gaze off at a hundred hill tops, and not see somebody’s
scarecrow waggling empty sleeves at me.
Piney and I have the spirits of eagles.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that nice,” said Helen, pleasantly.
“It’ll make such a good place to spend our vacations,
girls. While Piney and Kit are out soaring,
we can fish and tramp and have really
pleasant times.”</p>

<p>“Come on, girls,” Jean whispered, as Kit’s ire
started to rise. “It’s getting late now, truly, and
I have to rise while it is yet night, you know.
Good night all.”</p>

<p>She held the lamp at the foot of the stairs to
light the procession up to their rooms, then went
out into the kitchen. Shad sat over the kitchen
stove, humming softly under his breath an old
camp meeting hymn,</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p>“Good night, Shad,” she said. “And do be
sure and remember what I told you. Joe’s such
a little fellow. Don’t you scold him and make
him run away again, will you, even if he is
aggravating.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be good to him, I promise, Miss Jean,”
Shad promised solemnly. “I let my temper run
away from me that day, but I’ve joined the
church since then, and being a professor of religion
I’ve got to walk softly all the days of my
life, Mis’ Ellis says. Don’t you worry. Joe
and me’s as thick as two peas in a pod. I’ll be
a second grand uncle to him before I get
through.”</p>

<p>So it rested. Joe was still inclined to be a
little perverse where Shad was concerned, and
would sulk when scolded. Only Jean had been
able to make him see the error of his ways. He
would tell the others he guessed he’d run away.
But Jean had promptly talked to him, and said
if he wanted to run away, to run along any time
he felt like it. Joe had looked at her in surprise
and relief when she had said it, and had seemed
completely satisfied about staying thereafter.
It was Cousin Roxy who had given her the idea.</p>

<p>“I had a colt once that was possessed to jump
fences and go rambling, so one day after we’d
been on the run hunting for it nearly every day,
I told Hiram to let all the bars down, and never
mind the pesky thing. And it was so nonplussed
and surprised that it gave right up and stayed to
home. It may be fun jumping fences, but
there’s no real excitement in stepping over open
bars.”</p>

<p>So Joe had faced open bars for some time, and
if he could only get along with Shad, Jean knew
he would be safe while she was away. He was
an odd child, undemonstrative and shy, but there
was something appealing and sympathetic about
him, and Jean always felt he was her special
charge since she had coaxed him away from Mr.
Briggs.</p>

<p>The start next morning was made at seven,
before the sun was up. Princess was breathing
frostily, and side stepping restlessly. The tears
were wet on Jean’s cheeks as she climbed into the
seat beside Shad, and turned to wave goodbye
to the group on the veranda. She had not felt
at all this way when she had left for New York
to visit Bab, but someway this did seem, as the
Motherbird had said, like her first real flight from
the home nest.</p>

<p>“Write us everything,” called Kit, waving
both hands to her.</p>

<p>“Come back soon,” wailed Doris, and Helen,
running as Kit would have put it, true to form,
added her last message,</p>

<p>“Let us know if you meet the Contessa.”</p>

<p>But the Motherbird went back into the house
in silence, away from the sitting-room into a little
room at the side where Jean had kept her own
bookcase, desk, and a few choice pictures. A
volume of Browning selections, bound in soft
limp tan, lay beside Jean’s old driving gloves on
the table. Mrs. Robbins picked up both, laid her
cheek against the gloves and closed her eyes.
The years were racing by so fast, so fast, she
thought, and mothers must be wide eyed and
generous and fearless, when the children suddenly
began to top heads with one, and feel their
wings. She opened the little leather book to a
marked passage of Jean’s,</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';fs:0.9em;' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0' style='font-size:0.9em;'>“The swallow has set her young on the rail.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p>Ready for the flight, she thought. If it had
been Kit now, she would not have felt this curious
little pang. Kit was self sufficient and full of
buoyancy that was bound to carry her over
obstacles, but Jean was sensitive and dependent
on her environment for spur and stimulation.
She heard a step behind her and turned eagerly
as Mr. Robbins came into the room, seeking her.
He saw the book and the gloves in her hand, and
the look in her eyes uplifted to his own. Very
gently he folded his arms around her, his cheek
pressed close to her brown hair.</p>

<p>“She’s only seventeen,” whispered the Motherbird.</p>

<p>“Eighteen in April,” he answered. “And
dear, she isn’t trusting to her own strength for
the flight. Don’t you know this quiet little girl
of ours is mounted on Pegasus, and riding him
handily in her upward trend?”</p>

<p>But there was no winged horse or genius in
view to Jean’s blurred sight as she watched the
road unroll before her, and looking back, saw
only the curling smoke from Greenacres’ white
chimneys.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>CARLOTA</span></h1></div>

<p>“I thought you lived in a farmhouse too,
Cousin Beth,” Jean said, in breathless admiration,
as she laid aside her outer wraps, and stood
in the big living-room at Twin Oaks. The beautiful
country house had been a revelation to her.
It seemed to combine all of the home comfort and
good cheer of Greenacres with the modern air
and improvements of the homes at the Cove.
Sitting far back from the broad road in its stately
grounds, it was like some reserved but gracious
old colonial dame bidding you welcome.</p>

<p>The center hall had a blazing fire in the high
old rock fireplace, and Queen Bess, a prize
winning Angora, opened her wide blue eyes at
the newcomer, but did not stir. In the living-room
was another open fire, even while the house
was heated with hot air. There were flowering
plants at the windows, and freshly cut roses on
the tables in tall jars.</p>

<p>“You know, or maybe you don’t know,” said
Cousin Beth, “that we have one hobby here,
raising flowers, and specially roses. We exhibit
every year, and you’ll grow to know them and
love the special varieties just as I do. You have
no idea, Jean, of the thrill when you find a new
bloom different from all the rest.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised to find out anything
new and wonderful about this place,” Jean
laughed, leaning back in a deep-seated armchair.
Like the rest of the room’s furniture it wore a
gown of chintz, deep cream, cross barred in dull
apple green, with lovely, splashy pink roses scattered
here and there. Two large white Polar
rugs lay on the polished floor.</p>

<p>“If those were not members of the Peabody
family, old and venerated, they never would be
allowed to bask before my fire,” Cousin Beth
said. “But way back there was an Abner Peabody
who sailed the Polar seas, and used to bring
back trophies and bestow them on members of
his family as future heirlooms. Consequently,
we fall over these bears in the dark, and bless
great-grandfather Abner’s precious memory.”</p>

<p>After she was thoroughly toasted and had
drunk a cup of Russian tea, Jean found her way
up to the room that was to be hers during her
visit. It was the sunniest kind of a retreat in
daffodil yellow and oak brown. The furniture
was all in warm deep toned ivory, and there were
rows of blossoming daffodils and jonquils along
the windowsills.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think this is just darling,” Jean gasped,
standing in the middle of the floor and gazing
around happily. “It’s as if spring were already
here.”</p>

<p>“I put a drawing board and easel here for you
too,” Cousin Beth told her. “Of course you’ll
use my studio any time you like, but it’s handy
to have a corner all your own at odd times.
Carlota will be here tomorrow and her room is
right across the hall. She has inherited all of her
father’s talent, so I know how congenial you will
be. And you’ll do each other a world of good.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re thoroughly an American girl,
Jean, and Carlota is half Italian. You’ll understand
what I mean when you see her. She is
high strung and temperamental, and you are so
steady nerved and well balanced.”</p>

<p>Jean thought over this last when she was alone,
and smiled to herself. Why on earth did one
have to give outward and visible signs of temperament,
she wondered, before people believed one
had sensitive feelings or responsive emotions?
Must one wear one’s heart on one’s sleeve, so to
speak, for a sort of personal barometer? Bab
was high strung and temperamental too; so was
Kit. They both indulged now and then in mental
fireworks, but nobody took them seriously, or
considered it a mark of genius. She felt just a
shade of half amused tolerance towards this
Carlota person who was to get any balance or
poise out of her own nature.</p>

<p>“If Cousin Beth knew for one minute,” she
told the face in the round mirror of the dresser,
“what kind of a person you really are, she’d
never, never trust you to balance anybody’s
temperament.”</p>

<p>But the following day brought a trim, closed
car to the door, and out stepped Carlota and her
maid, a middle-aged Florentine woman who
rarely smiled excepting at her charge.</p>

<p>And Jean coming down the wide center flight
of stairs saw Cousin Beth before the fire with a
tall, girlish figure, very slender, and all in black,
even to the wide velvet ribbon on her long dark
braid of hair.</p>

<p>“This is my cousin Jean,” said Mrs. Newell,
in her pleasant way. She laid Carlota’s slim,
soft hand in Jean’s. “I want you two girls to
be very good friends.”</p>

<p>“But I know, surely, we shall be,” Carlota exclaimed.
And at the sound of her voice Jean’s
prejudices melted. She had very dark eyes with
lids that drooped at the outer corners, a rather
thin face and little eager pointed chin. Jean
tried and tried to think who it was she made her
think of, and then remembered. It was the little
statuette of Le Brun, piquant and curious.</p>

<p>“Now, you will not be treated one bit as guests,
girls,” Cousin Beth told them. “You must come
and go as you like, and have the full freedom of
the house. I keep my own study hours and like
to be alone then. Do as you like and be happy.
Run along, both of you.”</p>

<p>“She is wonderful, isn’t she?” Carlota said as
they went upstairs together. “She makes me feel
always as if I were a ship waiting with loose sails,
and all at once—a breeze—and I am on my way
again. You have not been to Sorrento, have
you? You can see the little fisher boats from
our terraces. It is all so beautiful, but now the
villa is turned into a hospital. Pippa’s brothers
and father are all at the front. Her father is
old, but he would go. She’s glad she’s an old
maid, she says, for she has no husband to grieve
over. Don’t you like her? She was my nurse
when I was born.”</p>

<p>“Her face reminds one of a Sybil. There’s
one—I forget which—who was middle-aged instead
of being old and wrinkled.”</p>

<p>“My father has used Pippa’s head often.
One I like best is ‘The Melon Vendor.’ That
was exhibited in Paris and won the Salon medal.
And it was so odd. Pippa did not feel at all
proud. She said it was only the magic of his
fingers that had made the statue a success, and
father said it was the inspiration from Pippa’s
face.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if you ever knew Bab Crane.
She’s a Long Island girl from the Cove where
we used to live, and she’s lived abroad every year
for two or three months with her mother. She
is an artist.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know her,” Carlota shook her head
doubtfully. “You see over there, while we entertained
a great deal, I was in a convent and
scarcely met anyone excepting in the summertime,
and then we went to my aunt’s villa up on
Lake Maggiore. Oh, but that is the most beautiful
spot of all. There is one island there called
Isola Bella. I wish I could carry it right over
here with me and set it down for you to see. It
is all terraces and splendid old statuary, and
when you see it at sunrise it is like a jewel, it
glows so with color.”</p>

<p>Jean curled her slippered feet under her as she
sat on the window seat, listening. There was
always a lingering love in her heart for the
“haunts of ancient peace” in Europe’s beauty
spots, and especially for Italy. Somewhere she
had read, it was called the “sweetheart of the
nations.”</p>

<p>“I’d love to go there,” she said now, with a
little sigh.</p>

<p>“And that is what I was always saying when
I was there, and my father told me of this country.
I wanted to see it so. He would tell me of
the great gray hills that climb to the north, and
the craggy broken shoreline up through Maine,
and the little handful of amethyst isles that lie
all along it. He was born in New Hampshire,
at Portsmouth. We are going up to see the
house some day, but I know just what it looks
like. It stands close down by the water’s edge
in the old part of the town, and there is a big
rambling garden with flagged walks. His grandfather
was a ship builder and sent them out, oh,
like argosies I think, all over the world, until
the steamboats came, and his trade was gone.
And he had just one daughter, Petunia. Isn’t
that a beautiful name, Petunia Pomeroy. It is
all one romance, I think, but I coax him to tell
it to me over and over. There was an artist who
came up from the south in one of his ships, and
he was taken very ill. So they took him in as a
guest, and Petunia cared for him. And when he
was well, what do you think?” She clasped her
hands around her knees and rocked back and
forth, sitting on the floor before her untouched
suitcases.</p>

<p>“They married.”</p>

<p>“But more than that,” warmly. “He carved
the most wonderful figureheads for my great
grandfather’s ships. All over the world they
were famous. His son was my father.”</p>

<p>It was indescribable, the tone in which she said
the last. It told more than anything else how
dearly she loved this sculptor father of hers.
That night Jean wrote to Kit. The letter on her
arrival had been to the Motherbird, but this was
a chat with the circle she knew would read it over
around the sitting room lamp.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>Dear Kit:</p>

<p>I know you’ll all be hungry for news. We motored out
from Boston, and child, when I saw the quaint old New
England homestead we had imagined, I had to blink my
eyes. It looks as if it belonged right out on the North
Shore at the Cove. It is a little like Longfellow’s home,
only glorified—not by fame as yet, though that will come—by
Greek wings. I don’t mean Nike wings. There are
sweeping porticos on each side where the drive winds
around. And inside it is summertime even now. They
have flowers everywhere, and raise roses. Kit, if you
could get one whiff of their conservatory, you would become
a Persian rose worshipper. When I come back, we’re
going to start a sunken rose garden, not with a few old
worn out bushes, but new slips and cuttings.</p>

<p>Carlota arrived the day after I did. She looks like the
little statuette of Le Brun on Mother’s bookcase, only her
hair hangs in two long braids. She is more Italian than
American in her looks, but seems to be very proud of her
American father. Helen would love her ways. She has
a maid, Pippa, from Florence, middle-aged, who used to
be her nurse. Isn’t that medieval and Juliet-like? But
she wears black and white continually, no gorgeous raiment
at all, black in the daytime, white for evening. I feel like
Pierrette beside her, but Cousin Beth says the girls of our
age dress very simply abroad.</p>

<p>The Contessa is coming out to spend the week end with
us, and will take Carlota and me back with her for a few
days. I’ll tell you all about her next time. We go for a
long trip in the car every day, but it is awfully cold and
bleak still. I feel exactly like Queen Bess, the Angora
cat, I want to hug the fires all the time, and Carlota says
she can’t bear our New England winters. At this time of
the year, she says spring has come in Tuscany and all
along the southern coast. She has inherited her father’s
gift for modelling, and gave me a little figurine of a fisher
boy standing on his palms, for a paper weight. It is perfect.
I wish I could have it cast in bronze. You know,
I think I’d rather be a sculptor than a painter. Someway
the figures seem so full of life, but then, Cousin Beth says,
they lack color.</p>

<p>I mustn’t start talking shop to you when your head is
full of forestry. Let me know how Piney takes to the
idea of going west, and be sure and remember to feed
Cherilee. Dorrie will think of her chickens and neglect
the canary sure. And help Mother all you can.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;'>With love to all,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>Jean</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>“Humph,” said Kit, loftily, when the letter
arrived and was duly digested by the circle. “I
suppose Jean feels as if the whole weight of this
household rested on her anxious young shoulders.”</p>

<p>“Well, we do miss her awfully,” Doris hurried
to say. “But the canary is all right.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and so is everything else. Wait till I
write to my elder sister and relieve her mind.
Let her cavort gaily in motor cars, and live side
by each with Angora cats in the lap of luxury.
Who cares? The really great ones of the earth
have dwelt in penury and loneliness on the solitary
heights.”</p>

<p>“You look so funny brandishing that dish
towel, and spouting, Kit,” Helen said, placidly.
“I’m sure I can understand how Jean feels and
I like it. It is odd about Carlota wearing
black and white, isn’t it? I wish Jean had told
more about her. I shall always imagine her in a
little straight gown of dull violet velvet, with a
cap of pearls.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that nice? How do you imagine me,
Helenita darling?” Kit struck a casual attitude
while she wiped the pudding dish.</p>

<p>“You’d make a nice Atalanta, the girl who
raced for the golden apples, or some pioneer
girl.”</p>

<p>“There’s a stretch of fancy for you, from
ancient Greece to Indian powwow times. Run
tell Shad to take up more logs to Father’s room,
or the astral spirit of our sweet sister will perch
on our bedposts tonight and rail at us right
lustily.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Doris, inquisitively.
“What’s an astral spirit?”</p>

<p>Kit screwed her face up till it looked like
Cynthy Allan’s, and prowled towards the
youngest of the family with portentous gestures.</p>

<p>“ ’Tain’t a ghost, and ’tain’t a spook, and
’tain’t a banshee. It’s the shadow of your self
when you’re sound asleep, and it goeth questing
forth on mischief bent. Yours hovers over the
chicken coops all night long, Dorrie, and mine
flits out to the eagles’ nests on mountain tops,
and Helenita’s digs into old chests of romance,
and hauls out caskets of jewels and scented
gowns by ye hundreds.”</p>

<p>“There’s the milk,” called Shad’s voice from
the entry way. “Better strain it right off and
get it into the pans. Mrs. Gorham’s gone to
bed with her neuralgy.”</p>

<p>Dorrie giggled outright at the interruption,
but Kit hurried to the rescue with the linen
straining cloth. It took more than neuralgia
to shake the mettle of a Robbins these days.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span><h1>CHAPTER XV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>AT MOREL’S STUDIO</span></h1></div>

<p>“I’ve just had a telephone message from the
Contessa,” Cousin Beth said at breakfast Saturday
morning. “She sends an invitation to us
for this afternoon, a private view of paintings
and sculpture at Henri Morel’s studio. She
knew him in Italy and France, and he leaves
for New York on Monday. There will be a
little reception and tea, nothing too formal for
you girls, so dress well, hold up your chins and
turn out your toes, and behave with credit to
your chaperon. It is your debut.”</p>

<p>Carlota looked at her quite seriously, thinking
she was in earnest, but Jean always caught the
flutter of fun in her eyes, and knew it would not
be as ceremonious as it sounded. When she was
ready that afternoon she slipped into Cousin
Beth’s own little den at the south end of the
house. Here were three rooms, all so different,
and each showing a distinct phase of character.
One was her winter studio. The summer one
was built out in the orchard. This was a large
sunny room, panelled in soft toned oak, with a
wood brown rug on the floor, and all the
treasures accumulated abroad during her years
there of study and travel. In this room Jean
used to find the girl Beth, who had ventured
forth after the laurels of genius, and found success
waiting her with love, back in little Weston.</p>

<p>The second room was a private sitting-room,
all willow furniture, and dainty chintz coverings,
with Dutch tile window boxes filled with blooming
hyacinths, and feminine knick-knacks scattered
about helterskelter. Here were framed
photographs of loved ones and friends, a portrait
of Elliott over the desk, his class colors on the
wall, and intimate little kodak snapshots he had
sent her. This was the mother’s and wife’s
room. And the last was her bedroom. Here
Jean found her dressing. All in deep smoke
gray velvet, with a bunch of single petaled violets
on her coat. She turned and looked at Jean
critically.</p>

<p>“I only had this new serge suit,” said Jean.
“I thought with a sort of fluffy waist it would
be right to wear.”</p>

<p>The waist was a soft crinkly crepe silk in dull
old gold, with a low collar of rose point, and just
a touch of Byzantine embroidery down the front.
Above it, Jean’s eager face framed in her brown
hair, her brown eyes, small imperative chin with
its deep cleft, and look of interest that Kit called
“questioning curiosity,” all seemed accentuated.</p>

<p>“It’s just right, dear,” said Cousin Beth.
“Go get a yellow jonquil to wear. Carlota will
have violets, I think. She loves them best.”</p>

<p>There was a scent of coming spring in the air
as they motored along the country roads, just a
delicate reddening of the maple twigs, and a
mist above the lush marshes down in the lower
meadows. Once Carlota called out joyously.
A pair of nesting bluebirds teetered on a fence
rail, talking to each other of spring housekeeping.</p>

<p>“Ah, there they are,” she cried. “And in
Italy now there will be spring everywhere. My
father told me of the bluebirds here. He said
they were bits of heaven’s own blue with wings
on.”</p>

<p>“How queer it is,” Jean said, “I mean the
way one remembers and loves all the little things
about one’s own country.”</p>

<p>“Not so much all the country. Just the spot
of earth you spring from. He loves this New
England.”</p>

<p>“And I love Long Island. I was born there,
not at the Cove, but farther down the coast near
Montauk Point, and the smell of salt water and
the marshes always stirs me. I love the long
green rolling stretches, and the little low hills in
the background like you see in paintings of the
Channel Islands and some of the ones along the
Scotch coast. Just a few straggly scrub pines,
you know, and the willows and wild cherry trees
and beach plums.”</p>

<p>“Somewhere I’ve read about that, girls; the
old earth’s hold upon her children. I’m afraid
I only respond to gray rocks and all of this sort
of thing. I’ve been so homesick abroad just to
look at a crooked apple tree in bloom that I
didn’t know what to do. Each man to his ‘ain
acre.’ Where were you born, Carlota?”</p>

<p>“At the Villa Marina. Ah, but you should
see it.” Carlota’s dark face glowed with love
and pride. “It is dull terra cotta color, and
then dull green too, the mold of ages, I think,
like the under side of an olive leaf, and flowers
everywhere, and poplars in long avenues. My
father laughs at our love for it, and says it
is just a mouldy old ruin, but every summer
we spend there. Some day perhaps you could
come to see us, Jean. Would they lend her
to us for a while, do you think, Mrs. Newell?”</p>

<p>“After the sick soldiers have all been sent
home well,” said Jean. “I should love to. Isn’t
it fun building air castles?”</p>

<p>“They are very substantial things,” Cousin
Beth returned, whimsically. “Hopes to me are
so tangible. We just set ahead of us the big
hope, and the very thought gives us incentive and
endeavor and what Elliott calls in his boy
fashion, ‘punch.’ Plan from now on, Jean, for
one spring in Italy. I’m scheming deeply, you
know, or perhaps you haven’t even guessed yet,
to get you a couple of years’ study here, then at
least one abroad, and after that, you shall try
your own strength.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be awful if I turned out just
ordinary!” Jean said with her characteristic
truthfulness. “I remember one girl down at
the Cove, Len Marden. We went through
school together, and her people said she was a
musical genius. She studied all the time, really
and truly. She was just a martyr, and she liked
it. They had plenty of means to give her every
chance, and she studied harmony in one city
abroad, and then something in another city, and
something else in another. We always used to
wonder where Len was trying her scales. Her
name was Leonora, and she used to dread it.
Why, her father even retired from business, just
to give his time up to watching over Len, and
her mother was like a Plymouth Rock hen,
brooding over her. Well, she came back last
fall, and just ran away and married one of the
boys from the Cove, and she says she doesn’t
give a rap for a career.”</p>

<p>Cousin Beth and Carlota both laughed heartily
at Jean’s seriousness.</p>

<p>“She has all of my sympathy,” the former declared.
“I don’t think a woman is able to give
her greatest powers to the world if she is gifted
unusually, until she has known love and motherhood.
I hope Leonora finds her way back to
the temple of genius with twins clinging to her
wing tips.”</p>

<p>It was just a little bit late when they arrived
at the Morel studio. Jean had expected it to
be more of the usual workshop, like Daddy Higginson’s
for instance, where canvases heaped
against the walls seemed to have collected the
dust of ages, and a broom would have been a
desecration. Here, you ascended in an elevator,
from an entrance hall that Cousin Beth declared
always made her think of the tomb of the
Pharoahs in “Aida.”</p>

<p>“All it needs is a nice view of the Nile by
moonlight, and some tall lilies in full bloom, and
someone singing ‘Celeste Aida,’ ” she told the
girls when they alighted at the ninth floor, and
found themselves in the long vestibule of the
Morel studio. Jean had rather a confused idea
of what followed. There was the meeting with
Morel himself. Stoop shouldered and thin, with
his vivid foreign face, half closed eyes, and odd
moustache like a mandarin’s. And near him
Madame Morel, with a wealth of auburn hair
and big dark eyes. She heard Carlota say just
before they were separated,</p>

<p>“He loves to paint red hair, and Aunt Signa
says she has the most wonderful hair you ever
saw, like Melisande.”</p>

<p>Cousin Beth had been taken possession of by
a stout smiling young man with eyeglasses and
was already the center of a little group. Jean
heard his name, and recognized it as that of a
famous illustrator. Carlota introduced her to
a tall girl in brown whom she had met in Italy,
and then somehow, Jean could not have told how
it happened, they drifted apart. Not but what
she was glad of a breathing spell, just a chance
as Shad would have said, to get her bearings.
Morel was showing some recent canvases, still
unframed, at the end of the studio, and everyone
seemed to gravitate that way.</p>

<p>Jean found a quiet corner near a tall Chinese
screen. Somebody handed her fragrant tea in
a little red and gold cup, and she was free to
look around her. A beautiful woman had just
arrived. She was tall and past first youth, but
Jean leaned forward expectantly. This must be
the Contessa. Her gown seemed as indefinite
and elusive in detail as a cloud. It was dull
violet color, with a gleam of gold here and there
as she moved slowly towards Morel’s group.
Under a wide brimmed hat of violet, you saw the
lifted face, with tired lovely eyes, and close
waves of pale golden hair. And this was not
all. Oh, if only Helen could have seen her,
thought Jean, with a funny little reversion to the
home circle. She had wanted a princess from
real life, or a contessa, anything that was
tangibly romantic and noble, and here was the
very pattern of a princess, even to a splendid
white stag hound which followed her with docile
eyes and drooping long nose.</p>

<p>“My dear, would you mind coaxing that
absent-minded girl at the tea table to part with
some lemon for my tea? And the Roquefort
sandwiches are excellent too.”</p>

<p>Jean turned at the sound of the new voice
beside her. There on the same settee sat a
robust, middle-aged late comer. Her satin coat
was worn and frayed, her hat altogether too
youthful with its pink and mauve butterflies
veiled in net. It did make one think of poor
Cynthy and her yearnings towards roses. Jean
saw, too, that there was a button missing from her
gown, and her collar was pinned at a wrong
angle, but the collar was real lace and the pin
was of old pearls. It was her face that charmed.
Framed in an indistinct mass of fluffy hair, gray
and blonde mixed, with a turned up, winning
mouth, and delightfully expressive eyes, it was
impossible not to feel immediately interested and
acquainted.</p>

<p>Before they had sat there long, Jean found
herself indulging in all sorts of confidences.
They seemed united by a common feeling of, not
isolation exactly, but newness to this circle.</p>

<p>“I enjoy it so much more sitting over here
and looking on,” Jean said. “Cousin Beth
knows everyone, of course, but it is like a painting.
You close one eye, and get the group
effect. And I must remember everything to
write it home to the girls.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about these girls. Who are they
that you love them so?” asked her new friend.
“I, too, like the bird’s eye view best. I told
Morel I did not come to see anything but his
pictures, and now I am ready for tea and talk.”</p>

<p>So Jean told all about Greenacres and the
girls there and before she knew it, she had disclosed
too, her own hopes and ambitions, and
perhaps a glimpse of what it might mean to the
others still in the nest if she, the first to fly, could
only make good. And her companion told her,
in return, of how sure one must be that the spark
of inspiration is really a divine one and worthy
of sacrifice, before one gives up all to it.</p>

<p>“Yonder in France, and in Italy too, but
mostly in France,” she said, “I have found girls
like you, my child, from your splendid homeland,
living on little but hopes, wasting their
time and what money could be spared them from
some home over here, following false hopes, and
sometimes starving. It is but a will-o’-the-wisp,
this success in art, a sort of pitiful madness that
takes possession of our brains and hearts and
makes us forget the daily road of gold that lies
before us.”</p>

<p>“But how can you tell for sure?” asked Jean,
leaning forward anxiously.</p>

<p>“Who can answer that? I have only pitied
the ones who could not see they had no genius.
Ah, my dear, when you meet real genius, then
you know the difference instantly. It is like the
real gems and the paste. There is consecration
and no thought of gain. The work is done
irresistibly, spontaneously, because they cannot
help it. They do not think of so called success,
it is only the fulfilment of their own visions that
they love. You like to draw and paint, you say,
and you have studied some in New York.
What then?”</p>

<p>Jean pushed back her hair impulsively.</p>

<p>“Do you know, I think you are a little bit
wrong. You won’t mind my saying that, will
you, please? It is only this. Suppose we are
not geniuses, we who see pictures in our minds
and long to paint them. I think that is the gift
too, quite as much as the other, as the power to
execute. Think how many go through life with
eyes blind to all beauty and color! Surely it
must be something to have the power of seeing
it all, and of knowing what you want to paint.
My Cousin Roxy says it’s better to aim at the
stars and hit the bar post, than to aim at the
bar post and hit the ground.”</p>

<p>“Ah, so. And one of your English poets says
too, ‘A man’s aim should outreach his grasp, or
what’s a heaven for?’ Maybe, you are quite
right. The vision is the gift.” She turned and
laid her hand on Jean’s shoulder, her eyes beaming
with enjoyment of their talk. “I shall remember
you, Brown Eyes.”</p>

<p>And just at this point Cousin Beth and Carlota
came towards them, the former smiling at
Jean.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you’ve monopolized the
Contessa long enough, young woman?” she
asked. Jean could not answer. The Contessa,
this whimsical, oddly gowned woman, who had
sat and talked with her over their tea in the
friendliest sort of way, all the time that Jean
had thought the Contessa was the tall lady in
the temperamental gown with the stag hound at
her heels.</p>

<p>“But this is delightful,” exclaimed the Contessa,
happily. “We have met incognito. I
thought she was some demure little art student
who knew no one here, and she has been so kind
to me, who also seemed lonely. Come now, we
will meet with the celebrities.”</p>

<p>With her arm around Jean’s waist, she led her
over to the group around Morel, and told them
in her charming way of how they had discovered
each other.</p>

<p>“And she has taught me a lesson that you,
Morel, with all your art, do not know, I am sure.
It is not the execution that is the crown of ambition
and aspiration, it is the vision itself. For
the vision is divine inspiration, but the execution
is the groping of the human hand.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I never could say it so beautifully,”
exclaimed Jean, pink cheeked and embarrassed,
as Morel laid his hand over hers.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless,” he said, gently, “success to
thy finger-tips, Mademoiselle.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>GREENACRE LETTERS</span></h1></div>

<p>Jean confessed her mistake to Cousin Beth
after they had returned home. There were just
a few moments to spare before bedtime, after
wishing Carlota and her aunt good night, and
she sat on a little stool before the fire in the
sitting-room.</p>

<p>“I hadn’t the least idea she was the Contessa.
You know that tall woman with the stag hound,
Cousin Beth—”</p>

<p>Mrs. Newell laughed softly, braiding her hair
down into regular schoolgirl pigtails.</p>

<p>“That was Betty Goodwin. Betty loves to
dress up. She plays little parts for herself all
the time. I think today she was a Russian
princess perhaps. The next time she will be a
tailor-made English girl. Betty’s people have
money enough to indulge her whims, and she has
just had her portrait done by Morel as a sort of
dream maiden, I believe. I caught a glimpse of
it on exhibition last week. Looks as little like
Betty as I do. Jean, child, paint if you must,
but paint the thing as you see it, and do choose
apple trees and red barns rather than dream
maidens who aren’t real.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I shall paint,” Jean
answered, with a little quick sigh. “She rather
frightened me, I mean the Contessa. She thinks
only real geniuses should paint.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. Paint all you like. You’re
seventeen, aren’t you, Jean?”</p>

<p>Jean nodded. “Eighteen in April.”</p>

<p>“You seem younger than that. If I could,
I’d swamp you in paint and study for the next
two years. By that time you would have either
found out that you were tired to death of it, and
wanted real life, or you would be doing something
worth while in the art line. But in any
event you would have no regrets. I mean you
could trot along life’s highway contentedly,
without feeling there was something you had
missed. It was odd your meeting the Contessa
as you did. She likes you very much. I wish
it could be arranged for you to go over to Italy
in a year, and be under her wing. It’s such a
broadening experience for you, Jeanie. Perhaps
I’ll be going myself by then and could take
you. You would love it as I did, I know.
There’s a charm and restfulness about old world
spots that all the war clamour and devastation
cannot kill. Now run along to bed. Tomorrow
will be a quiet day. The Contessa likes it
here because she can relax and as she says ‘invite
her soul to peace.’ Good night, dear.”</p>

<p>When Jean reached her own room, she found
a surprise. On the desk lay a letter from home
that Minory had laid there. Minory was Cousin
Beth’s standby, as she said. She was middle-aged,
and had been “help” to the Peabodys ever
since she was a girl. Matrimony had never attracted
Minory. She had never been known to
have a sweetheart. She was tall and spare, with
a broad serene face, and sandy-red hair worn
parted in the middle and combed smoothly back
over her ears in old-fashioned style. Her eyes
were as placid and contented as a cat’s, and
rather greenish, too, in tint.</p>

<p>“Minory has reached Nirvana,” Cousin Beth
would say, laughingly. “She always has a little
smile on her lips, and says nothing. I’ve never
seen her angry or discontented. She’s saved her
earnings and bought property, and supports
several indigent relatives who have no earthly
right to her help. Her favorite flower, she says,
is live forever, as we call it here in New England,
or the Swiss edelweiss. She’s a faithful Unitarian,
and her favorite charity is orphan
asylums. All my life I have looked up to
Minory and loved her. There’s a poem called
‘The Washer of the Ford,’ I think it is, and she
has made me think of it often, for over and over
at the passing out of dear ones in the family,
it has been Minory’s hand on my shoulder that
has steadied me, and her hand that has closed
their eyes. She stands and holds the candle for
the rest of us.”</p>

<p>It was just like her, Jean thought, to lay the
home letter where it would catch her eye and
make her happy before she went to sleep. One
joy of a letter from home was that it turned out
to be a budget as soon as you got it out of the
envelope. The one on top was from the Motherbird,
written just before the mail wagon came
up the hill.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>DEAR PRINCESS ROYAL:</p>

<p>You have been much on my mind, but I haven’t time for
a long letter, as Mr. Ricketts may bob up over the hill any
minute, and he is like time and tide that wait for no man,
you know. I am ever so glad your visit has proved a
happy one. Stay as long as Cousin Beth wants you.
Father is really quite himself these days, and I have kept
Mrs. Gorham, so the work has been very easy for me, even
without my first lieutenant.</p>

<p>It looks like an early spring, and we expect Ralph and
Honey from the west in about a week, instead of in May.
Ralph will probably be our guest for awhile, as Father
will enjoy his company. The crocuses are up all along the
garden wall, and the daffodils and narcissus have started
to send up little green lances through the earth. I have
never enjoyed the coming of a spring so much as now.
Perhaps one needs a long bleak winter in order to appreciate
spring.</p>

<p>Have you everything you need? Let me know otherwise.
You know, I always find some way out. A letter came
for you from Bab which I enclose. Write often to us, my
eldest fledgling. I feel very near you these days in love
and thought. The petals are unfolding so fast in your
character. I want to watch each one, and you know this,
dear. There is always a curious bond between a firstborn
and a mother, to the mother specially, for you taught me
motherhood, all the dear, first motherlore, my Jean. Some
day you will understand what I mean, when you look down
into the face of your own. I must stop, for I am getting
altogether homesick for you.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:5em;'>Tenderly,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>Mother</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>Jean sat for a few minutes after reading this,
without unfolding the girls’ letters. Mothers
were wonderful persons, she thought. Their
brooding wings stretched so far over one, and
gave forth a love and protectiveness such as
nothing else in the world could do.</p>

<p>The next was from Helen, quite like her too.
Brief and beautifully penned on her very own
violet tinted note paper.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>DEAR JEANIE:</p>

<p>I do hope you have met the wonderful Contessa. I
can picture her in my mind. You know Father’s picture
of Marie Stuart with the pearl cap? Well, I’ve been wondering
if she looked like that. I know they wore pearl
caps in Italy because Juliet wore one. I’d love a pearl
cap. Tell me what Carlota talks about, and what color
are her eyes!</p>

<p>School is very uninteresting just now, and it is cold
driving over to the car. But I have one teacher I love,
Miss Simmons. Jean, she has the face of Priscilla exactly,
and she is descended from Miles Standish, really and truly.
She told me so, and Kit said if all of his descendants could
be bunched together, they would fill a state. You know
Kit. Miss Simmons wears a low lace collar with a small
cameo pin, and her voice is beautiful. I can’t bear people
with loud voices. When I see her in the morning, it just
wipes out all the cold drive and everything that’s gone
wrong. Well, Kit says it’s time to go to bed. I forgot
to tell you, unless Mother has already in her letter, that
Mr. McRae is coming from Saskatoon with Honey, and he
will stay here. Doris hopes he will bring her a tame
bear cub.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:5em;'>Your loving sister,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>Helen Beatrice Robbins</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>“Oh, Helenita, you little goose,” Jean
laughed, shaking her head. The letter was so
entirely typical of Helen and her vagaries. A
mental flash of the dear old Contessa in a pearl
cap came to her. She must remember to tell
Cousin Beth about that tomorrow.</p>

<p>Doris’s letter was hurried and full of maternal
cares.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>DEAR SISTER:</p>

<p>We miss you awfully. Shad got hurt yesterday. His
foot was jammed when a tree fell on it, but Joe is helping
him, and I think they like each other better.</p>

<p>We are setting all the hens that want to set. The minute
I notice one clucking I tell Mother, and we fix a nest
for her. Father has the incubator going, but it may go
out if we forget to put in oil, Shad says, and the hens don’t
forget to keep on the nests. Bless Mother Nature, Mrs.
Gorham says. She made caramel filling today the way
you do, and it all ran out in the oven, and she said the
funniest thing. “Thunder and lightning.” Just like that.
And when I laughed, she told me not to because she ought
not to say such things, but when cooking things went contrariwise,
she just lost her head entirely. Isn’t that fun?
Send me a pressed pink rose. I’d love it.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:5em;'>Lovingly yours,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>Dorrie</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>Last of all was Kit’s, six sheets of pencilled
scribbling, crowded together on both sides.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>I’m writing this the last thing at night, dear sister mine,
when my brain is getting calm. Any old time the poet
starts singing blithesomely of ye joys of springtide I hope
he lands on this waste spot the first weeks in March.
Jean, the frost is thawing in the roads, and that means the
roads are simply falling in. You drive over one in the
morning, and at night it isn’t there at all. There’s just a
slump, understand. I’m so afraid that Princess will break
her legs falling into a Gilead quagmire, I hardly dare
drive her.</p>

<p>I suppose Mother has written that we have a guest coming
from Saskatoon. I feel very philosophical about it.
It will do Dad good, and I’ll be glad to see Honey again.
Billie’s coming home for Easter, thank goodness. He’s
human. Do you suppose you will be here then? What do
you do all day? Gallivant lightsomely around the adjacent
landscape with Cousin Beth, or languish with the
Contessa and Carlota in some luxurious spot, making believe
you’re nobility too. Remember, Jean Robbins, the
rank is but the guinea’s stamp, “a man’s a man for a’ that.”
Whatever would you do without your next sister to keep
you balanced along strict republican lines? Don’t mind
me. We’ve been studying comparisons between forms of
government at school, and I’m completely jumbled on it
all. I can’t make up my mind what sort of a government
I want to rule over. This kingship business seems to be
so uncertain. Poor old King Charles and Louis, and the
rest. I’m to be Charlotte Corday at the prison window in
one of our monthly tableaux. Like the picture?</p>

<p>If you do see any of the spring styles, don’t be afraid
to send them home. Even while we cannot indulge, it’s
something to look at them. I don’t want any more middies.
They are just a subterfuge. I want robes and garments.
And how are the girls wearing their hair in quaint
old Boston town? Mine’s getting too long to do anything
with, and I feel Quakerish with it. It’s an awful nuisance
trying to look like everybody else. I’ll be glad when I
can live under a greenwood tree some place, with a stunning
cutty sark on of dull green doeskin. Do you know
what a cutty sark is? Read Bobby Burns, my child. I
opine it’s a cross between a squaw’s afternoon frock and a
witch’s kirtle. But it is graceful and comfortable, and I
shall always wear one when I take to the forest to stay.</p>

<p>I have a new chum, a dog. Shad says he’s just as
much of a stray as Joe was, but he isn’t. He’s a shepherd
dog, and very intelligent. I’ve called him Mac. He
fights like sixty with Shad, but you just ought to see him
father that puppy of Doris’s you brought up from New
York. He trots him off to the woods with him, and
teaches him all sorts of dog tricks. Doris had him cuddled
and muffled up until he was a perfect little molly-coddle.
I do think she would take the natural independence
out of a kangaroo just by petting it.</p>

<p>I miss you in the evenings a whole lot. Helen goes
around in a sort of moon ring of romance nowadays, so
it’s no fun talking to her, and Dorrie is all fussed up over
her setting hens and the incubator natural born orphans,
so I am left to my own devices. Did you ever wish we
had some boys in the family? I do now and then. I’d
like one about sixteen, just between us two, that I could
chum with. Billie comes the nearest to being a kid brother
that I’ve ever had. That boy really had a dandy sense of
fairness, Jean, do you know it? I hope being away at
school hasn’t spoilt him. And that makes me think. The
Judge and Cousin Roxy were down to dinner Sunday, and
the flower of romance still blooms for them. It’s just
splendid to see the way he eyes her, not adoringly, but
with so much appreciation, Jean, and he chuckles every
time she springs one of her delicious sayings. I don’t
see how he ever let her travel her own path so many
years.</p>

<p>Well, my dear, artistic close relative and beloved sister,
it is almost ten <span class='sc'>P. M.</span>, and Shad has wound the clock, and
locked the doors, and put wood on the fire, so it’s time for
Kathleen to turn into her lonely cot. Give my love to
Cousin Beth, and write to me personally. We can’t bear
your inclusive family letters.</p>

<p>Fare ye well, great heart. We’re taking up Hamlet
too, in English. Wasn’t Ophelia a quitter?</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:5em;'>Yours,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='sc'>Kit</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>If it had not been too late, Jean felt she could
have sat down then and there, and answered
every one of them. They took her straight back
to Greenacres and all the daily round of fun
there. In the morning she read them all to
Carlota, sitting on their favorite old Roman seat
out in the big central greenhouse. Here were
only ferns and plants like orchids, begonias, and
delicate cyclamen. There was a little fountain
in the center, and several frogs and gold fish
down among the lily pads.</p>

<p>“Ah, but you are lucky,” Carlota cried in her
quick way. “I am just myself, and it’s so
monotonous. I wish I could go back with you,
even for just a few days, and know them all.
Kit must be so funny and clever.”</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t you? Mother’d love to have
you, and the girls are longing to know what you
look like. I’d love to capture you and carry you
into our old hills. Perhaps by Easter you could
go. Would the Contessa let you, do you think?”</p>

<p>Carlota laughed merrily, and laid her arm
around Jean’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“I think she would let me do anything you
wished. Let us go now and ask her.”</p>

<p>The Contessa had not joined them at breakfast.
She preferred her tray in Continental
fashion, brought up by Minory, and they found
her lying in the flood of sunshine from the south
window, on the big comfy chintz covered couch
drawn up before the open fireplace. Over a
faded old rose silk dressing gown she wore a
little filmy lace shawl the tint of old ivory that
matched her skin exactly. Jean never saw her
then or in after years without marvelling at the
perpetual youth of her eyes and smile. She
held out both hands to her with an exclamation
of pleasure, and kissed her on her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Ah, Giovanna mia,” she cried. “Good
morning. Carlota has already visited me, and
see, the flowers, so beautiful and dear, which
your cousin sent up—roses and roses. They are
my favorites. Other flowers we hold sentiment
for, not for their own sakes, but because there
are associations or memories connected with
them, but roses bring forth homage. At my
little villa in Tuscany which you must see some
time, it is very old, very poor in many ways, but
we have roses everywhere. Now, tell me, what
is it you two have thought up. I see it in your
eyes.”</p>

<p>“Could I take Carlota home with me for a
little visit when I go?” asked Jean. “It isn’t so
very far from here, just over in the corner of
Connecticut where Rhode Island and Massachusetts
meet, and by Easter it will be beautiful in
the hills. And it’s perfectly safe for her up
there. Nothing ever happens.”</p>

<p>The Contessa laughed at her earnestness.</p>

<p>“We must consult with your cousin first,” she
said. “If we can have you with us in Italy then
we must let Carlota go with you surely. We
sail in June. I have word from my sister.
Would you like to go, child?”</p>

<p>Jean sat down on the chair by the bedside and
clasped her hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, it just couldn’t happen,” she said in
almost a hushed tone. “I’m sure it couldn’t,
Contessa. Perhaps in another year, Cousin
Beth said she might be going over, and then I
could be with her. But not yet.”</p>

<p>The Contessa lifted her eyebrows and smiled
whimsically.</p>

<p>“But what if there is a conspiracy of happiness
afoot? Then you have nothing to say, and
I have talked with your cousin, and she has
written to another cousin, Roxy, I think she calls
her. Ah, you have such wonderful women
cousins, Giovanna, they are all fairy godmothers
I think.”</p>

<p>Jean liked to be called Giovanna. It gave
her a curious feeling of belonging to that life
Carlota told her of, in the terra cotta colored
villa among the old terraces and rose gardens
overlooking the sea. She remembered some of
Browning’s short poems that she had always
liked, the little fragment beginning,</p>

<p>“If you keep on day dreaming over possibilities,
Jean Robbins,” she told herself in her
mirror, “you’ll be quite as bad as Helen. You
keep your two feet on the ground, and stop fluttering
wings.”</p>

<p>Whereupon for the remainder of the stay at
Cousin Beth’s, she bent to study with a will, until
Easter week loomed near, and it was time to
think of starting for the hills once more. Carlota
was going with her, and so excited and expectant
over the trip that the Contessa declared
she almost felt like accompanying them, just to
discover this marvelous charm that seemed to
enfold Greenacres and its girls.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>BILLIE’S FIGHTING CHANCE</span></h1></div>

<p>It was the Friday before Easter when they
arrived. Jean looked around eagerly as she
jumped to the platform, wondering which of the
family would drive down to meet them, but instead
of Kit or Shad, Ralph McRae stepped up
to her with outstretched hand. All the way
from Saskatoon, she thought, and just the same
as he was a year before. As Kit had said then,
in describing him:</p>

<p>“He doesn’t look as if he could be the hero,
but he’d always be the hero’s best friend, like
Mercutio was to Romeo, or Gratiano to Benvolio.
If he couldn’t be Robin Hood, he’d be
Will Scarlet, not Alan a Dale. I couldn’t imagine
him ever singing serenades.”</p>

<p>Jean introduced him to Carlota, who greeted
him in her pretty, half foreign way, and Mr.
Briggs waved a welcome as he trundled the express
truck past them down the platform.</p>

<p>“Looks a bit like rain. Good for the
planters,” he called.</p>

<p>Princess took the long curved hill from the
station splendidly, and Jean lifted her head
to it all, the long overlapping hill range that
unfolded as they came to the first stretch
of level road, the rich green of the pines
gracing their slopes, and most of all the
beautiful haze of young green that lay like a
veil over the land from the first bursting leaf
buds.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s good to be home,” she exclaimed.
“Over at Cousin Beth’s the land seems so level,
and I like hills.”</p>

<p>“They were having some sort of Easter exercises
at school, and the girls could not drive
down,” Ralph said. “Honey and I arrived two
days ago, and I asked for the privilege of coming
down. Shad’s busy planting out his first
lettuce and radishes in the hotbeds, and Mrs.
Robbins is up at the Judge’s today. Billie’s
pretty sick, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Billie?” cried Jean. “Not Billie?”</p>

<p>Even to think of Billie’s being ill was absurd.
It was like saying a raindrop had the measles,
or the wind seemed to have an attack of whooping
cough. He had never been sick all the years
he had lived up there, bare headed winter and
summer, free as the birds and animals he loved.
All the long drive home she felt subdued in a
way.</p>

<p>“He came back from school Monday and they
are afraid of typhoid. I believe conditions at
the school were not very good this spring, and
several of the boys came down with it. But I’m
sure if anybody could pull him through it would
be Mrs. Ellis,” said Ralph.</p>

<p>But even with the best nursing and care,
things looked bad for Billie. It was supper time
before Mrs. Robbins returned. Carlota had
formed an immediate friendship with Mr. Robbins,
and they talked of her father, whom he
had known before his departure for Italy. For
anyone to have known and appreciated her
father, was a sure passport to Carlota’s favor.
It raised them immensely in her estimation, and
she was delighted to find, as she said, “somebody
whose eyes have really looked at him.”</p>

<p>Kit was indignant and stunned at the blow
that had fallen on her chum, Billie. She never
could take the slings and arrows of outrageous
fortune in the proper humble spirit anyway.</p>

<p>“The idea that Billie should have to be sick,”
she cried. “How long will he be in bed,
Mother?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, dear,” Mrs. Robbins said.
“He’s sturdy and strong, but the fever usually
has to run its course. Dr. Gallup came right
over.”</p>

<p>“Bless him,” Kit put in fervently. “He’ll
get him well in no time. I don’t think there
ever was a doctor so set on making people well.
I’d rather see him come in the door, no matter
what ailed me, sit down and tell me I had just
a little distemper, open his cute little black case,
and mix me up that everlasting mess that tastes
like cinnamon and sugar, than have a whole line
up of city specialists tapping me.”</p>

<p>Helen and Doris clung closely to Jean, taking
her and Carlota around the place to show her all
the new chicks, orphans and otherwise. Greenacres
really was showing signs of full return this
year for the care and love spent on its rehabilitation.
The fruit trees, after Shad’s pruning and
fertilizing, and general treatment that made
them look like swaddled babies, were blossoming
profusely, and on the south slope of the field
along the river, rows and rows of young peach
trees had been set out. The garden too, had
come in for its share of attention. Helen loved
flowers, and had worked there more diligently
than she usually could be coaxed to on any sort
of real labor. Shad had cleared away the old
dead canes first, and had plowed up the central
plot, taking care to save all the perennials.</p>

<p>“You know what I wish, Mother dear,” said
Helen, standing with earth stained fingers in the
midst of the tangle of old vines and bushes. “I
wish we could lay out paths and put stones down
on them, flat stones, I mean, like flags. And
have flower beds with borders. Could we, do
you think? And maybe a sun dial. I’d love to
have a sun dial in our family.”</p>

<p>Her earnestness made Mrs. Robbins smile, but
she agreed to the plan, and Cousin Roxy helped
out with slips from her flower store, so that the
prospect for a garden was very good. And
later Honey Hancock came up with Piney to
advise and help too. The year out west had
turned the bashful country boy into a stalwart,
independent individual whom even Piney regarded
with some respect. He was taller than
her now, broad shouldered, and sure of himself.</p>

<p>“I think Ralph has done wonders with him,”
Piney said. “Mother thinks so too. He can
pick her right up in his arms now, and walk
around with her. She doesn’t seem to mind
going west any more, after seeing what it’s made
of Honey, and hearing him tell of it. And
Ralph says we’ll always keep the home here so
that when we want to come back, we can. I
think he likes Gilead someway. He says it
never seems just like home way out west. You
need to walk on the earth where your fathers and
grandfathers have trod, and even to breathe the
same air. Mother says the only place she hates
to leave behind is our little family burial plot
over in the woods.”</p>

<p>In the days following Easter, while Mrs.
Robbins was over at the Ellis place helping
care for Billie, Helen, Piney and Carlota formed
a fast friendship, much to Jean and Kit’s
wonderment. It was natural for Helen and
Carlota to be chums, but Carlota was enthusiastic
over Piney, her girl of the hills, as she
called her.</p>

<p>“Oh, but she is glorious,” she cried, the first
day, as she stood at the gate posts watching
Piney dash down the hill road on Mollie. “My
father would love to model her head. She is so
fearless. And I am afraid of lots and lots of
things. She is like the mountain girls at home.
And her real name—Proserpine. It is so good
to have a name that is altogether different. My
closest girl friend at the convent was Signa
Palmieri and she has a little sister named Assunta.
I like them both, and I like yours, Jean.
What does it mean?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Jean answered, musingly, as
she bent to lift up a convolvulus vine that was
trying to lay its tendrils on the old stone wall.
“It is the feminine of John, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Then it means beloved. That suits you.”
Carlota regarded her seriously. “My aunt says
you have the gift of charm and sympathy.”</p>

<p>Jean colored a little. She was not quite used
to the utter frankness of Carlota’s Italian nature.
While she and the other girls never hesitated to
tell just what they thought of each other, certainly,
as Kit would have said, nobody tossed
over these little bouquets of compliment. It was
entirely against the New England temperament.</p>

<p>Just as Carlota started to say more there came
a long hail from the hill, and coming down they
saw Kit and Sally Peckham, with long wooden
staffs. Sally dawned on Carlota with quite as
much force as Piney had. Her heavy red gold
hair hung today in two long plaits down her
back. She wore a home-made blue cloth skirt
and a loose blouse of dark red, with the neck
turned in, and one of her brothers’ hats, a grey
felt affair that she had stuck a quail’s wing in.</p>

<p>“Hello,” called Kit, “we’ve been for a hike,
clear over to the village. Mother ’phoned she
needed some things from the drug store, so we
thought we’d walk over and get them. Billie’s
just the same. He don’t know a soul, and all
he talks about is making his math. exams. I
think it’s perfectly shameful to take a boy like
that who loves reading and nature and natural
things, and grind him down to regular stuff.”</p>

<p>She reached the stone gateway, and sat down
on a rock to rest, while Jean introduced Sally,
who bowed shyly to the slim strange girl in
black.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you had company, excepting
Mr. McRae,” she said. “Kit wanted me to walk
over with her.”</p>

<p>“I love a good long hike,” interrupted Kit.
“Specially when I feel bothered or indignant.
We’ve kept up the hike club ever since the roads
opened up, Jean. It’s more fun than anything
out here, I never realized there was so much to
know about just woods and fields until Sally
taught me where to hunt for things. Do you
like to hike, Carlota?”</p>

<p>“Hike?” repeated Carlota, puzzled. “What
is it?”</p>

<p>“A hike is a long walk.”</p>

<p>Carlota laughed in her easy-going way.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Not too long. I think I’d
rather ride.”</p>

<p>“I also,” Helen said flatly. “I don’t see a bit
of fun dragging around like Kit does, through
the woods and over swamps, climbing hills, and
always wanting to get to the top of the next
one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I love to,” Kit chanted. “Maybe
I’ll be a mountain climber yet. Children, you
don’t grasp that it is something strange and interesting
in my own special temperament. The
longing to attain, the—the insatiable desire to
seize adventure and follow her fleeing footsteps,
the longing to tap the stars on their foreheads
and let them know I’m here.”</p>

<p>“Kit’s often like this,” said Helen, confidentially
to Carlota. “You mustn’t mind her
a bit. You see, she believes she is the genius of
the family, and sometimes, I do too, almost.”</p>

<p>“There may be a spark in each of us,” Kit said
generously. “I’ll not claim it all. Let’s get
back to the house. I’m famished, and I’ve
coaxed Sally to stay and lunch with us.”</p>

<p>“What good times many can have,” Carlota
slipped her arm in Jean’s on the walk back
through the garden. “Sometimes I wish I had
been many too, I mean with brothers and sisters.
You feel so oddly when you are all the family in
yourself.”</p>

<p>“Well,” laughed Jean, “it surely has some disadvantages,
for every single one wants something
different at the same identical moment,
and that is comical now and then, but we like
being a tribe ourselves. I think the more one
has to divide their interests and sympathies, the
more it comes back to them in strength. Cousin
Roxy said that to me once, and I liked it. She
said no human beings should have all their eggs
in one nest, but make a beautiful omelet of them
for the feeding of the multitude. Isn’t that
good?”</p>

<p>Carlota had not seen Cousin Roxy yet. With
Billie down seriously ill, the Judge’s wife had
shut out the world at large, and instituted herself
his nurse in her own sense of the word, which
meant not only caring for him, but enfolding
him in such a mantle of love and inward power
of courage that it would have taken a cordon of
angels to get him away from her.</p>

<p>Still, those were long anxious days through
the remainder of April. Mrs. Gorham and
Jean managed the other house, while Mrs. Robbins
helped out at the sick room. There was a
trained nurse on hand too, but her duties were
largely to wait on Cousin Roxy, and as Mrs.
Robbins said laughingly, it was the only time in
her life when she had seen a trained nurse browbeaten.</p>

<p>Kit was restless and uneasy over her chum’s
plight. She would saddle Princess and ride
over on her twice a day to see what the bulletins
were, and sometimes sit out in the old fashioned
garden watching the windows of the room where
Cousin Roxy kept vigil. She almost resented
the joyous activity of the bees and birds in their
spring delirium when she thought of their comrade
Billie, lying there fighting the fever.</p>

<p>And oddly enough, the old Judge would join
her, he who had lived so many years ignoring
Billie’s existence, sit and hold her hand in his,
gazing out at the sunlight and the growing
things of the old garden, and now and then
giving vent to a heavy sigh. He, too, missed
his boy, and realized what it might mean if the
birds and bees and ants and all the rest of Billie’s
small brotherhood, were to lose their friend.</p>

<p>Jean never forget the final night. She had a
call over the telephone from her mother about
nine, to leave Mrs. Gorham in charge, and come
to her.</p>

<p>“Dear, I want you here. It’s the crisis, and
we can’t be sure what may happen. Billie’s in
a heavy sleep now, and the old Doctor says we
can just wait. Cousin Roxy is with him.”</p>

<p>Jean laid off her outer cloak and hat, and
went in where old Dr. Gallup sat. It always
seemed foolish to call him old although his years
bordered on three score. His hair was gray and
straggled boyishly as some football hero’s, his
eyes were brown and bright, and his smile something
so much better than medicine that one just
naturally revived at the sight of him, Cousin
Roxy used to say. He sat by the table, looking
out the window, one hand tapping the edge, the
other deep in his pocket. One could not have
said whether he was taking counsel of Mother
Nature, brooding out there in the shadowy
spring night, or lifting up his heart to a higher
throne.</p>

<p>“Hello, Jeanie, child,” he said, cheerily.
“Going to keep me company, aren’t you? Did
you come up alone?”</p>

<p>“Shad drove me over. Doctor, Billie is all
right, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“We hope so,” answered the old doctor.
“But what is it to be all right? If the little lad’s
race is run, it has been a good one, Jeanie, and
he goes out fearlessly, and if not, then he is all
right too, and we hope to hold him with us. But
when this time comes and it’s the last sleep before
dawn, there’s nothing to do but watch and wait.”</p>

<p>“But do you think—”</p>

<p>Jean hesitated. She could not help feeling
he must know what the hope was.</p>

<p>“He’s got a fine fighting chance,” said the
doctor. “Now, I’m going in with Mrs. Ellis,
and you comfort the Judge and brace him up.
He’s in the study there.”</p>

<p>It was dark in the study. Jean opened the
door gently, and looked in. The old Judge sat
in his deep, old arm chair by the desk, and his
head was bent forward. She did not say a word,
but tiptoed over, and knelt beside him, her cheek
against his sleeve. And the Judge laid his arm
around her shoulders in silence, patting her
absent-mindedly. So they sat until out of the
windows the garden took on a lighter aspect,
and there came the faint twittering of birds
wakening in their nests.</p>

<p>Jean, watching the beautiful miracle of the
dawn, marvelled. The dew lent a silvery radiance
to every blade of grass, every leaf and
twig. There was an unearthly, mystic beauty
to the whole landscape and the garden. She
thought of a verse the girls had found once, when
they had traced Piney’s name in poesy for Kit’s
benefit, one from “The Garden of Proserpine.”
Something about the pale green garden, and
these lines,</p>

<p>And just then the old doctor put his head in
the door and sang out cheerily,</p>

<p>“It’s all right. Billie’s awake.”</p>

<p>Carlota’s stay was lengthened from one week
to three at Jean’s personal solicitation. The
Contessa wrote that so long as the beloved child
was enjoying herself and benefiting in health
among “the hills of rest,” she would not dream
of taking her back to the city, while spring trod
lightly through the valleys.</p>

<p>“Isn’t she poetical, though?” Kit said, thoughtfully,
as she knelt to make some soft meal for a
new batch of Doris’s chicks. Carlota had read
the letter aloud to the family at the breakfast
table, and they could hear her now playing the
piano and singing with Jean and Helen,
“Pippa’s” song:</p>

<p>“No wonder Carlota is posted on all the
romance and poetry of the old world. All
Helen has done since she came is moon around
and imagine herself Rosamunda in her garden.
It makes me tired with all the spring work hanging
over to be done. How many broods does
this make, Dorrie?”</p>

<p>“Eight,” said Dorrie, “and more coming.
Shad said he understood we were going to sell
off all the incubated ones at ten cents apiece,
and keep the real brooders for the family.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” Kit leaned back against the side
of the barn, and looked lazily off at the widening
valley vista before her. “I am so afraid that
Dad will get too much interested in chicken
raising and crops and soils and things, so that
we’ll stay on here forever. Somehow I didn’t
mind it half as much all through the winter time,
but now that spring is here, it is just simply
awful to have to pitch in and work from the
rising of the sun even unto its going down. I
want to be a ‘lily of the field.’ ”</p>

<p>Overhead the great fleecy, white clouds sailed
up from the south in a squadron of splendor. A
new family of bluebirds lately hatched was calling
hungrily from a nest in the old cherry tree
nearby, and being scolded lustily by a catbird
for lack of patience. There was a delicate haze
lingering still over the woods and distant fields.
The new foliage was out, but hardly enough to
make any difference in the landscape’s coloring.
After two weeks of almost daily showers there
had come a spell of close warm weather that
dried up the fields and woods, and left them as
Cousin Roxy said “dry as tinder and twice as
dangerous.”</p>

<p>“How’s Billie?” asked Doris, suddenly. “I’ll
be awfully glad when he’s out again.”</p>

<p>“They’ve got him on the veranda bundled up
like a mummy. He’s so topply that you can
push him over with one finger-tip and Cousin
Roxy treats him as if she had him wadded up
in pink cotton. I think if they just stopped
treating him like a half-sick person, and just let
him do as he pleased he’d get well twice as fast.”</p>

<p>Doris had been gazing up at the sky dreamily.
All at once she said,</p>

<p>“What a funny cloud that is over there, Kit.”</p>

<p>It hung over a big patch of woods towards the
village, a low motionless, pearl colored cloud,
very peculiar looking, and very suspicious, and
the odd part about it was that it seemed balanced
on a base of cloud, like a huge mushroom or a
waterspout in shape.</p>

<p>“What on earth is that?” exclaimed Kit,
springing to her feet. “That’s never a cloud,
and it is right over the old Ames place. Do
you suppose they’re out burning brush with the
woods so dry?”</p>

<p>“There’s nobody home today. Don’t you
know it’s Saturday, and Astrid said they were
all going to the auction at Woodchuck hill.”</p>

<p>Kit did not wait to hear any more. She sped
to the house like a young deer and, with eyes
quite as startled, she burst into the kitchen and
called up the back stairs.</p>

<p>“Mother, do you see that smoke over the
Ames’s woods?”</p>

<p>“Smoke,” echoed Mrs. Robbins’ voice.
“Why, no, dear, I haven’t noticed any. Wait
a minute, and I’ll see.”</p>

<p>But Kit was by nature a joyous alarmist.
She loved a new thrill, and in the daily monotony
that smothered one in Gilead anything that
promised an adventure came as a heaven sent
relief. She flew up the stairs, stopping to call
in at Helen’s door, and send a hail over the front
banister to Jean and Carlota. Her father and
mother were standing at the open window when
she entered their room, and Mr. Robbins had
his field glasses.</p>

<p>“It is a fire, isn’t it, Dad?” Kit asked, eagerly,
and even as she spoke there came the long, shrill
blast of alarm on the Peckham mill whistle.
There was no fire department of any kind for
fourteen miles around. Nothing seemed to
unite the little outlying communities of the hill
country so much as the fire peril, but on this
Saturday it happened that nearly all the available
men had leisurely jaunted over to the
Woodchuck Hill auction. This was one of the
characteristics of Gilead, shunting its daily tasks
when any diversion offered.</p>

<p>“Oh, listen,” exclaimed Helen, who had hurried
in also. “There’s the alarm bell ringing up
at the church too. It must be a big one.”</p>

<p>Even as she spoke the telephone bell rang
downstairs, while Shad called from the front
garden:</p>

<p>“Fearful big fire just broke out between here
and Ames’s. I’m going over with the mill boys
to help fight it.”</p>

<p>“Can I go too, Shad?” cried Joe eagerly. “I
won’t be in the way, honest, I won’t.”</p>

<p>“Go ’long, you stay here, an’ if you see that
wing of smoke spreadin’ over this way, you
hitch up, quick as you can, an’ drive the folks
out of its reach.” Shad started off up the road
with a shovel over one shoulder and a heavy mop
over the other. Jean was at the telephone. It
was Judge Ellis calling.</p>

<p>“He’s worried over Cousin Roxy, Mother,”
Jean called up the stairs. “Cynthy wanted her
to come over to her place today to get some
carpet rags, and Cousin Roxy drove over there
about an hour ago. He says her place lies right
in the path of the fire. Mrs. Gorham has gone
away for the day to the auction with Ben, and
the Judge will have to stay with Billie. He’s
terribly anxious.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dad,” exclaimed Kit, “couldn’t I please,
please, go over and stay with Billie, and let the
Judge come up to the fire, if he wants to. I’m
sure he’s just dying to. Not but what I’m sure
Cousin Roxy can take care of herself. May I?
Oh, you dear. Tell him I’m coming, Jean.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re going,” said Helen, aggrievedly,
“and you’ll ride Princess over there, and how on
earth are the rest of us going to be rescued if the
fire comes this way.”</p>

<p>“My dear child, and beloved sister, if you see
yon flames sweeping down upon you, get hence
to Little River, and stand in it midstream. I’m
sure there isn’t one particle of danger. Just
think of Astrid and Ingeborg coming back from
the auction, and maybe finding their house just
a pile of ashes.”</p>

<p>Carlota stood apart from the rest, her dark
eyes wide with surprise and apprehension. A
forest fire to her meant a great devastating,
irresistible force which swept over miles of acreage.
Her father had told her, back in the old
villa, of camping days in the Adirondacks, when
he had been caught in the danger zone, and had
fought fires side by side with the government
rangers. She did not realize that down here in
the little Quinnibaug Hills, a wood fire in the
spring of the year was looked upon as a natural
visitation, rather calculated to provide amusement
and occupation to the boys and men, as
well as twenty cents an hour to each and every
one who fought it.</p>

<p>Jean had left the telephone and was putting
on her coat and hat.</p>

<p>“Mother,” she asked, “do you mind if Carlota
and I just walk up the wood road a little
way? We won’t go near the fighting line where
the men are at all, and I’d love to see it. Besides
I thought perhaps we might work our
way around through that big back wood lot to
Cynthy’s place and see if Cousin Roxy is there.
Then, we could drive back with them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, can’t I go too?” asked Doris, eagerly.
“I won’t be one bit in the way. Please say yes,
Mother, please?”</p>

<p>“I can’t, dear,” Mrs. Robbins patted her
youngest, hurriedly. “Why, yes, Jean, I think
it’s safe for you to both go. Don’t you, Jerry?”</p>

<p>Mr. Robbins smiled at Jean’s flushed, excited
face. It was so seldom the eldest robin lost her
presence of mind, and really became excited.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it will hurt them a bit,” he said.
“Dorrie and Helen had better stay here though.
They will probably be starting back fires, and
you two girls will have all you can do, to take
to your own heels, without looking out for the
younger ones.”</p>

<p>With a couple of golf capes thrown over their
shoulders, the two girls started up the hill road
for about three quarters of a mile. The church
bell over at the Plains kept ringing steadily.
At the top of the hill they came to the old wood
road that formed a short cut over to the old
Ames place. Here where the trees met overhead
in an arcade the road was heavy with black
mud, and they had to keep to the side up near
the old rock walls. As they advanced farther
there came a sound of driving wheels, and all at
once Hedda’s mother appeared in her rickety
wagon. She sat far forward on the seat, a
man’s old felt hat jammed down over her heavy,
flaxen hair, and an old overcoat with the collar
upturned, thrown about her. Leaning forward
with eager eyes, the reins slack on the horse’s
back, giving him full leeway, she seemed to be
thoroughly enthusiastic over this new excitement
in Gilead.</p>

<p>“Looks like it’s going to be some fire, girls.
I’m givin’ the alarm along the road. Giddap!”
She slapped the old horse madly with the reins,
and shook back the wind blown wisps of hair
from her face like a Valkyrie scenting battle.</p>

<p>“Did you see?” asked Carlota, wonderingly.
“She wore men’s boots too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and she runs a ninety acre farm with the
help of Hedda, thirteen years old, and two hired
men. She gets right out into the fields with
them and manages everything herself. I think
she’s wonderful. They are Icelanders.”</p>

<p>Another team coming the opposite way held
Mr. Rudemeir and his son August. An array
of mops, axes, and shovels hung out over the
back seat. Mr. Rudemeir was smoking his clay
pipe, placidly, and merely waved one hand at the
girls in salutation, but August called,</p>

<p>“It has broken out on the other side of the
road, farther down.”</p>

<p>“Is it going towards the old Allan place?”
asked Jean, anxiously. “Mrs. Ellis is down
there with Cynthy, and the Judge telephoned
over he’s anxious about them. That’s where we
are going.”</p>

<p>“Better keep out,” called back old Rudemeir
over his shoulder. “Like enough she’ll drive
right across the river, if she sees the fire comin’.
Can’t git through this way nohow.”</p>

<p>The rickety old farm wagon disappeared
ahead of them up the road. Jean hesitated,
anxiously. The smoke was thickening in the
air, but they penetrated farther into the woods.
Up on the hill to one side, she saw the Ames
place, half obscured already by the blue haze.
It lay directly in the path of the fire, unless the
wind happened to change, and if it should change
it would surely catch Carlota and herself if they
tried to reach Cynthy’s house down near the
river bank. Still she felt that she must take the
chance. There was an old wood road used by the
lumber men, and she knew every step of the way.</p>

<p>“Come on,” she said to Carlota. “I’m sure
we can make it.”</p>

<p>They turned now from the main road into an
old overgrown byway. Along its sides rambled
ground pine, and wintergreen grew thickly in
the shade of the old oaks. Jean took the lead,
hurrying on ahead, and calling to Carlota that
it was just a little way, and they were absolutely
safe. When they came out on the river road,
the little mouse colored house was in sight, and
sure enough, Ella Lou stood by the hitching
post.</p>

<p>Jean never stopped to rap at the door. It
stood wide open, and the girls went through the
entry into the kitchen. It was empty.</p>

<p>“Cousin Roxy,” called Jean, loudly. “Cousin
Roxy, are you here?”</p>

<p>From somewhere upstairs there came an answering
hail.</p>

<p>“Pity’s sakes, child!” exclaimed Cousin Roxy,
appearing at the top of the stairs with her arms
full of carpet rags. “What are you doing
down here? Cynthy and I are just sorting out
some things she wanted to take over to my
place.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you seen the smoke? All the woods
are on fire up around the Ames place. The
Judge was worried, and telephoned for us to
warn you.”</p>

<p>“Land!” laughed Mrs. Ellis. “Won’t he
ever learn that I’m big enough and old enough
to take care of myself. I never saw a Gilead
wood fire yet that put me in any danger.”</p>

<p>She stepped out of the doorway, pushed her
spectacles up on her forehead and sniffed the
air.</p>

<p>“ ’Tis kind of smoky, ain’t it,” she said.
“And the wind’s beginning to shift.” She
looked up over the rise of the hill in front of the
house. Above it poured great belching masses
of lurid smoke. Even as she looked the huge
wing-like mass veered and swayed in the sky
like some vast shapes of genii. Jean caught
her breath as she gazed, but Carlota said anxiously,</p>

<p>“We must look out for the mare, she is frightened.”</p>

<p>Ella Lou, for the first time since Jean had
known her, showed signs of being really frightened.
She was tugging back at the rope halter
that held her to the post, her eyes showing the
whites around them, and her nostrils wide with
fear. Cousin Roxy went straight down to her,
unhitched her deftly, and held her by the bridle,
soothing her and talking as one would to a human
being.</p>

<p>“Jean, you go and get Cynthy quick as you
can!” she called.</p>

<p>Jean ran to the house and met Cynthy groping
her way nervously downstairs.</p>

<p>“What on earth is it?” she faltered. “Land,
I ain’t had such a set-to with my heart in years.
Is the fire comin’ this way? Where’s Roxy?”</p>

<p>“She says for you to come right away.
Please, please hurry up, Miss Allan.”</p>

<p>But Cynthy sat down in a forlorn heap on
the step, rocking her arms, and crying, piteously.</p>

<p>“Oh, I never, never can leave them, my poor,
precious darlings. Can’t you get them for me,
Jean? There’s General Washington and Ethan
Allen, Betsy Ross and Pocahontas, and there’s
three new kittens in my yarn basket in the old
garret over the ‘L.’ ”</p>

<p>Jean realized that she meant her pet cats,
dearer to her probably than any human being
in the world. Supporting her gently, she got
her out of the house, promising her she would
find the cats. For the next five minutes, just at
the most crucial moment, she hunted for the cats,
and finally succeeded in coaxing all of them into
meal bags. Every scurrying breeze brought
down fluttering wisps of half burned leaves
from the burning woods. The shouts of the
men could be plainly heard calling to each other
as they worked to keep the fire back from the
valuable timber along the river front.</p>

<p>“I think we’ve just about time to get by before
the fire breaks through,” said Mrs. Ellis,
calmly. Jean was on the back seat, one arm
supporting old Cynthy, her other hand pacifying
the rebellious captives in the bag. Carlota
was on the front seat. She was very quiet and
smiling a little. Jean thought how much she
must resemble her mother, the young Contessa
Bianca, who had been in full charge of the Red
Cross Hospital, across the sea, for months.</p>

<p>Not a word was said as Cousin Roxy turned
Ella Lou’s white nose towards home, but they
had not gone far before the mare stopped short
of her own free will, snorting and backing. The
wind had changed suddenly, and the full force
of the smoke from the fire-swept area poured
over them suffocatingly. Cynthy rose to her
feet in terror, Jean’s arm around her waist, trying
to hold her down, as she screamed.</p>

<p>“For land’s sakes, Cynthy, keep your head,”
called Mrs. Ellis. “If it’s the Lord’s will that
we should all go up in a chariot of fire, don’t
squeal out like a stuck pig. Hold her close,
Jean. I’m going to drive into the river.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='317' id='Page_317'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>RALPH’S HOMELAND</span></h1></div>

<p>At the bend of the road the land sloped suddenly
straight for the river brink. A quarter of
a mile below was the dam, above Mr. Rudemeir’s
red saw mill. Little River widened at this point,
and swept in curves around a little island.
There were no buildings on it, only broad low
lush meadows that provided a home for muskrats
and waterfowl. Late in the fall fat otters
could be seen circling around the still waters,
and wild geese and ducks made it a port of call
in their flights north and south.</p>

<p>As Ella Lou started into the water, Carlota
asked just one question.</p>

<p>“How deep is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it varies in spots,” answered Cousin
Roxy, cheerfully; her chin was up, her firm lips
set in an unswerving smile, holding the reins in
a steady grasp that steadied Ella Lou’s footing.
To Jean she had never seemed more resourceful
or fearless. “There’s some pretty deep holes,
here and there, but we’ll trust to Ella Lou’s
common sense, and the workings of divine Providence.
Go ’long there, girl, and mind your
step.”</p>

<p>Ella Lou seemed to take the challenge personally.
She felt her way along the sandy bottom,
daintily, and the wheels of the two seated
democrat sank to the hubs. Out in midstream
they met the double current, sweeping around
both sides of the island; and here for a minute or
two, danger seemed imminent. Cousin Roxy
gave a quick look back over her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Can you swim, Jean?” Jean nodded, and
held on to the cats and Cynthy, grimly. It was
hard saying which of the two were proving the
more difficult to manage. The wagon swayed
perilously, but Ella Lou held to her course, and
suddenly they felt the rise of the shore line again.
Overhead, there had flown a vanguard of frightened
birds, flying ahead of the smothering clouds
of smoke that poured now in blinding masses
down from the burning woods. The cries and
calls of the men working along the back fire line
reached the little group on the far shore, faintly.</p>

<p>As the mare climbed up the bank, dripping
wet and snorting, Cousin Roxy glanced back
over her shoulder at the way they had come.
Cynthy gave one look too, and covered her face
with her hands. The flames had swept straight
down over her little home, and she cried out in
anguish.</p>

<p>“Pity’s sakes, Cynthy, praise God that the
two of us aren’t burning up this minute with
those old shingles and rafters,” cried Mrs. Ellis,
joyfully. “I could rise and sing the Doxology,
water soaked as I am, and mean it more than I
ever have in all of my life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, and Miss Allan, not one of the cats got
wet even,” Jean exclaimed, laughing, almost
hysterically. “You don’t know what a time I
had holding that bag up out of the water. Do
turn around and look at the wonderful sight.
See, Carlota!”</p>

<p>But Carlota had jumped out of the wagon
with Cousin Roxy, and the two of them were
petting and tending Ella Lou, who stood trembling
in every limb, her eyes still wide with fear.</p>

<p>“You wonderful old heroine, you,” said Carlota,
softly. “I think we all owe our lives to
your courage.”</p>

<p>“She’s a fine mare, if I do say so, God bless
her.” Cousin Roxy unwound her old brown
veil and used it to wipe off Ella Lou’s dripping
neck and back. If her own cloak had been dry
she would have laid it over her for a cover.</p>

<p>The flames had reached the opposite shore,
but while the smoke billowed across, Little River
left them high and dry in the safety zone.</p>

<p>“I guess we’d better be making for home as
quick as we can,” said Cousin Roxy. Except
for a little pallor around her lips, and an extra
brightness to her eyes, no one could have told
that she had just caught a glimpse of the Dark
Angel’s pinions beside that river brink. She
pushed back her wisps of wavy hair, climbed
back into the wagon, and turned Ella Lou’s nose
towards home.</p>

<p>The Judge was watching anxiously, pacing
up and down the long veranda with Billie sitting
in his reed chair bolstered up with pillows beside
him. He had telephoned repeatedly down to
Greenacres, but they were all quite as anxious
now as himself. It was Billie who first caught
a sight of the team and its occupants.</p>

<p>Kit had gone out into the kitchen to start
dinner going. She had refused to believe that
any harm could come to Cousin Roxy or anyone
under her care, and at the sound of Billie’s voice,
she glanced from the window, and caught sight
of Jean’s familiar red cap.</p>

<p>“Land alive, don’t hug me to death, all of
you,” exclaimed Cousin Roxy. “Jean, you go
and telephone to your mother right away, and
relieve her anxiety. Like enough, she thinks
we’re all burned to cinders by this time, and tell
her she’d better have plenty of coffee and sandwiches
made up to send over to the men in the
woods. All us women will have our night’s
work cut out for us.”</p>

<p>It was the girls’ first experience of a country
forest fire. All through the afternoon the fresh
relays of men kept arriving from the nearby
villages, and outlying farms, ready to relieve
those who had been working through the morning.
Up at the little white church, the old bell
rope parted and Sally Peckham’s two little
brothers distinguished themselves forever by
climbing to the belfry, lying on their backs on
the old beams, and taking their turns kicking
the bell.</p>

<p>There was but little sleep for any members of
the family that night. Jean never forgot the
thrill of watching the fire from the cupola windows,
and with the other girls she spent most of
the time up there until daybreak. There was a
fascination in seeing that battle from afar, and
realizing how the little puny efforts of a handful
of men could hold in check such a devastating
force. Only country dwellers could appreciate
the peril of having all one owned in the world,
all that was dear and precious, and comprised
in the word “home,” swept away in the path of
the flames.</p>

<p>“Poor old Cynthy,” said Jean. “I’m so glad
she has her cats. I shall never forget her face
when she looked back. Just think of losing all
the little keepsakes of a lifetime.”</p>

<p>It was nearly five o’clock when Shad returned.
He was grimy and smoky, but exuberant.</p>

<p>“By jiminitty, we’ve got her under control,”
he cried, executing a little jig on the side steps.
“Got some hot coffee and doughnuts for a fellow?
Who do you suppose worked better than
anybody? Gave us all cards and spades on how
to manage a fire. He says this is just a little
flea bite compared with the ones he has up home.
He says he’s seen a forest fire twenty miles wide,
sweeping over the mountains up yonder.”</p>

<p>“Who do you mean, Shad,” asked Jean.
“For goodness’ sake tell us who it is, and stop
spouting.”</p>

<p>“Who do you suppose I mean?” asked Shad,
reproachfully. “Honey Hancock’s cousin,
Ralph McRae, from Saskatoon.”</p>

<p>Jean blushed prettily, as she always did when
Ralph’s name was mentioned. She had hardly
seen him since his arrival, owing to Billie’s illness,
and Carlota’s visit with her. Still, oddly
enough, even Shad’s high praise of him, made
her feel shyly happy.</p>

<p>The fire burned fitfully for three days, breaking
out unexpectedly in new spots, and keeping
everyone excited and busy. The old Ames barn
went up in smoke, and Mr. Rudemeir’s saw mill
caught fire three times.</p>

<p>“By gum!” he said, jubilantly, “I guess I sit
out on that roof all night long, slapping sparks
with a wet mop, but it didn’t get ahead of
me.”</p>

<p>Sally and Kit ran a sort of pony express, riding
horseback from house to house, carrying
food and coffee over to the men who were scattered
nearly four miles around the fire-swept
area. Ralph and Piney ran their own rescue
work at the north end of town. Honey had
been put on the mail team with Mr. Ricketts’
eldest boy, while the former gave his services on
the volunteer fire corps. The end of the third
day Jean was driving back from Nantic station,
after she had taken Carlota down to catch the
local train to Providence. The Contessa had
sent her maid to meet her there, and take her on
to Boston. It had been a wonderful visit, Carlota
said, and already she was planning for Jean’s
promised trip to the home villa in Italy.</p>

<p>Visions of that visit were flitting through
Jean’s mind as she drove along the old river
road, and she hardly noticed the beat of hoofs
behind her, until Ralph drew rein on Mollie beside
her. They had hardly seen each other to
talk to, since her return from Boston.</p>

<p>“The fire’s all out,” he said. “We have left
some of the boys on guard yet, in case it may be
smouldering in the underbrush. I have just
been telling Rudemeir and the other men, if
they’d learn to pile their brush the way we do
up home, they would be able to control these
little fires in no time. You girls must be awfully
tired out. You did splendid work.”</p>

<p>“Kit and Sally did, you mean,” answered
Jean. “All I did was to help cook.” She
laughed. “I never dreamt that men and boys
could eat so many doughnuts and cup cakes.
Cousin Roxy says she sent over twenty-two
loaves of gingerbread, not counting all the other
stuff. Was any one hurt, at all?”</p>

<p>“You mean eating too much?” asked Ralph,
teasingly. Then more seriously, he added, “A
few of the men were burnt a little bit, but nothing
to speak of. How beautiful your springtime
is down here in New England. It makes
me want to take off my coat and go to work
right here, reclaiming some of these old worked
out acres, and making them show the good that
still lies in them if they are plowed deep enough.”</p>

<p>Jean sighed, quickly.</p>

<p>“Do you really think one could ever make any
money here?” she asked. “Sometimes I get
awfully discouraged, Mr. McRae. Of course,
we didn’t come up here with the idea of being
farmers. It was Dad’s health that brought us,
but once we were here, we couldn’t help but see
the chance of making Greenacres pay our way
a little. Cousin Roxy has told us we’re in
mighty good luck to even get our vegetables
and fruit out of it this last year, and it isn’t the
past year I am thinking of; it’s the next year,
and the next one and the next. One of the most
appalling things about Gilead is, that you get
absolutely contented up here, and you go around
singing blissfully, ‘I’ve reached the land of corn
and wine, and all its blessings freely mine.’ Old
Daddy Higginson who taught our art class
down in New York always said that contentment
was fatal to progress, and I believe it.
Father is really a brilliant man, and he’s getting
his full strength back. And while I have a full
sense of gratitude towards the healing powers of
these old green hills, still I have a horror of
Dad stagnating here.”</p>

<p>Ralph turned his head to watch her face, giving
Mollie her own way, with slack rein.</p>

<p>“Has he said anything himself about wanting
to go back to his work?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not yet. I suppose that is what we really
must wait for. His own confidence returning.
You see, what I’m afraid of is this: Dad was
born and brought up right here, and the granite
of these old hills is in his system. He loves
every square foot of land around here. Just
supposing he should be contented to settle down,
like old Judge Ellis, and turn into a sort of
Connecticut country squire.”</p>

<p>“There are worse things than that in the
world,” Ralph replied. “Too many of our best
men forget the land that gave them birth, and
pour the full strength of their mature powers
and capabilities into the city mart. You speak
of Judge Ellis. Look at what that old fellow’s
mind has done for his home community. He
has literally brought modern improvements into
Gilead. He has represented her up at Hartford
off and on for years, when he was not sitting
in judgment here.”</p>

<p>“You mean, that you think Dad ought not to
go back?” asked Jean almost resentfully. “That
just because he happened to have been born
here, he owes it to Gilead to stay here now, and
give it the best he has?”</p>

<p>Ralph laughed, good naturedly.</p>

<p>“We’re getting into rather deep water, Miss
Jean,” he answered. “I can see that you don’t
like the country, and I do. I love it down east
here where all of my folks came from originally,
and I’m mighty fond of the west.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sure I’d like that too,” broke in
Jean, eagerly. “Mother’s from the west, you
know. From California, and I’d love to go out
there. I would love the wide scope and freedom
I am sure. What bothers me here, are
those rock walls, for instance.” She pointed at
the old one along the road, uneven, half tumbling
down, and overgrown with gray moss; the standing
symbol of the infinite patience and labor of
a bygone generation. “Just think of all the
people who spent their lives carrying those
stones, and cutting up all this beautiful land into
these little shut-in pastures.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but those rocks represent the clearing
of fields for tillage. If they hadn’t dug them
out of the ground, they wouldn’t have had any
cause for Thanksgiving dinners. I’m mighty
proud of my New England blood, and I want
to tell you right now, if it wasn’t for the New
England blood that went out to conquer the
West, where would the West be today?”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Jean, a bit crossly for
her, “but if they had pioneered a little bit right
around here, there wouldn’t be so many run
down farms. What I would like to do, now
that Dad is getting well, is make Greenacres our
playground in summertime, and go back home
in the winter.”</p>

<p>“Home,” he repeated, curiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, we were all born down in New York,”
answered Jean, looking south over the country
landscape, as though she could see Manhattan’s
panoramic skyline rising like a mirage of beckoning
promises. “I am afraid that is home to
me.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span><h1>CHAPTER XX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>OPEN WINDOWS</span></h1></div>

<p>“It always seems to me,” said Cousin Roxy,
the first time she drove down with Billie to spend
the day, “as if Maytime is a sort of fulfilled
promise to us, after the winter and spring.
When I was a girl, spring up here behaved itself.
It was sweet and balmy and gentle, and
now it’s turned into an uncertain young tomboy.
The weather doesn’t really begin to settle until
the middle of May, but when it does—” She
drew in a deep breath, and smiled. “Just look
around you at the beauty it gives us.”</p>

<p>She sat out on the tree seat in the big old-fashioned
garden that sloped from the south
side of the house to what Jean called “the close.”
The terraces were a riot of spring bloom; tall
gold and purple flag lilies grew side by side with
dainty columbine and poet’s narcissus. Along
the stone walls white and purple lilacs flung their
delicious perfume to every passing breeze. The
old apple trees that straggled in uneven rows
up through the hill pasture behind the barn, had
been transformed into gorgeous splashy masses
of pink bloom against the tender green of
young foliage.</p>

<p>“What’s Jean doing over there in the orchard?”
Kit rose from her knees, her fingers
grimy with the soil, her face flushed and warm
from her labors, and answered her own query.</p>

<p>“She’s wooing the muse of Art. What was
her name? Euterpe or Merope? Well, anyway
that’s who she’s wooing, while we, her
humble sisters, who toil and delve after cut
worms—Cousin Roxy, why are there any cut
worms? Why are there fretful midges? Or
any of those things?”</p>

<p>“Land, child, just as home exercises for our
patience,” laughed Mrs. Ellis, happily.</p>

<p>Jean was out of their hearing. Frowning
slightly, with compressed lips, she bent over her
work. With Shad’s help she had rigged up a
home-made easel of birchwood, and a little three
legged camp stool. As Shad himself would
have said, she was going to it with a will. The
week before she had sent off five studies to
Cousin Beth, and two of her very best ones,
down to Mr. Higginson. Answers had come
back from both, full of criticism, but with plenty
of encouragement, too. Mrs. Robbins had read
the two letters and given her eldest the quick
impulsive embrace which ever since her babyhood
had been to Jean her highest reward of
merit. But it was from her father, perhaps,
that she derived the greatest happiness. He
laid one arm around her shoulders, smiling at
her with a certain whimsical speculation, in his
keen, hazel eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, girlie, if you will persist in developing
such talent, we can’t afford to hide this candle
light under a bushel. Bethiah has written also,
insisting that you are given your chance to go
abroad with her later on.”</p>

<p>“What does Mother say?” asked Jean,
quickly. She knew that the only thing that
might possibly hold her back from the trip
abroad would be her mother’s solicitude and
loving fears for her welfare.</p>

<p>“She’s perfectly willing to let you go as long
as Cousin Beth goes with you. It would only
be for three months.”</p>

<p>“But when?” interrupted Jean. “It isn’t
that I want to know for my own pleasure, but
you don’t know how fearfully precious these last
years in the ’teens seem to me. There’s such a
terrible lot of things to learn before I can really
say I’ve finished.”</p>

<p>“And one of the first things you have to learn
is just that you never stop learning. That you
never really start to learn until you attain the
humility of knowing your own limitations. So
don’t you worry, Jeanie, you can’t possibly go
over to Europe and swallow its Art Galleries in
three months. By the way, if you are really going,
you had better start in learning some of the
guide posts.”</p>

<p>He crossed over to one of his book cases, and
picked out an old well-worn Baedeker bound
in red morocco, “Northern Italy.” He opened
it lovingly, and its passages were well underlined
and marked in pencil all the way through.
There were tiny sprays of pressed flowers and
four leaved clovers, a five pointed fig leaf, and
some pale silver gray olive ones. “Leaves from
Vallambrosa,” he quoted, softly. “Your mother
and I followed those old world trails all through
our honeymoon, my dear.”</p>

<p>Jean leaned over his shoulder, eagerly, her
arms clasped around his neck, her cheek pressed
to his.</p>

<p>“You dear,” she said, fervently. “Do you
know what I’m going to do with the very first
five thousand dollars I receive for a masterpiece?
I shall send you and the Motherbird
flying back to visit every single one of those
places. Won’t you love it, though?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather take all you kiddies with us. You
gain so much more when you share your knowledge
with others. Do you know what this west
window makes me think of, Jean?” He
pointed one hand to the small side window that
looked far down the valley. “Somewhere over
yonder lies New York. Often times through
the past year, I have stood there, and felt like
Dante at his tower window, in old Guido Di
Rimini’s castle at Ravenna. Joe’s pigeons
circling around down there make me think of
the doves which he called ‘Hope’s messengers’
bringing him memories in his exile from his beloved
Florence.”</p>

<p>Jean slipped down on her knees beside him,
her face alight with gladness.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dad, Dad, you do want to go back,” she
cried. “You don’t know how afraid I’ve been
that you’d take root up here and stay forever.
I know it’s perfectly splendid, and it has been a
place of refuge for us all, but now that you are
getting to be just like your old self—”</p>

<p>Her father’s hand checked her.</p>

<p>“Steady, girlie, steady,” he warned. “Not
quite so fast. I am still a little bit uncertain
when I try to speed up. We’ve got to be
patient a little while longer.”</p>

<p>Jean pressed his hand in hers, and understood.
If it had been hard for them to be patient, it had
been doubly so for him, groping his way back
slowly, the past year, on the upgrade to health.</p>

<p>Softly she repeated a poem that was a favorite
of Cousin Roxy’s, and which he had liked to
hear.</p>

<p>Jean was thinking of their talk as she sat out
in the orchard today, trying to catch some of the
fleeting beauty of its blossom laden trees. It
was an accepted fact now, her trip abroad with
Mrs. Newell, and they planned to sail the first
week in September, so as to catch the Fall
Academy and Exhibitions, all the way from
London south to Rome. A letter from Bab had
told her of the Phelps boy’s success; after fighting
for it a year he had taken the <span class='it'>Prix de Rome</span>.
This would give him a residence abroad, three
years with all expenses paid, full art tuition and
one thousand dollars in cash. Babbie had written:</p>

<p>“I am teasing Mother to trot over there once
again, and am pretty sure she will have to give
in. The poor old dear, if only she would be contented
to let me ramble around with Hedda, we
would be absolutely safe, but she always acts as
if she were the goose who had not only laid a
golden egg, but had hatched it. And behold me
as the resultant genius. Anyway we’ll all hope
to meet you down at Campodino. I hear the
Contessa’s villa there is perfectly wonderful.
Mother says it’s just exactly like the one that
Browning rented during his honeymoon. He
tells about it in ‘DeGustibus.’ I believe most
of the rooms have been Americanized since the
Contessa married Carlota’s father, and you don’t
have to go down to the seashore when you want
to take a bath. But the walls are lovely and
crumbly with plenty of old lizards running in
and out of the mold. I envy you like sixty. I
wish I had a Contessa to tuck me under her wing
like that.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>“How are you getting along, girlie?” asked a
well known voice behind her.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Dad,” said Jean, leaning back
with her head on one side, looking for all the
world, as Kit would have said, like a meditative
brown thrush. “I can’t seem to get that queer
silver gray effect. You take a day like this, just
before a rain, and it seems to underlie everything.
I’ve tried dark green and gray and sienna, and
it doesn’t do a bit of good.”</p>

<p>“Mix a little Chinese black with every color
you use,” said her father, closing one eye to look
at her painting. “It is the old masters’ trick.
You’ll find it in the Flemish school, and the
Veronese. It gives you the atmospheric gray
quality in everything. Hello, here come Ralph
and Piney.”</p>

<p>Piney waved her hand in salutation, but joined
Kit and Helen in the lower garden at their grubbing
for cut worms.</p>

<p>“If you put plenty of salt in the water when
you sprinkle those, it’ll help a lot,” she told them.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve salted them. Shad told us that.
We each took a bag of salt and went out sprinkling
one night, and then it rained, and I honestly
believe it was a tonic to the cut worm colony.
The only thing to do, is go after them and annihilate
them.”</p>

<p>Ralph lifted his cap in greeting to the group
on the terrace, but went on up to the orchard.
Kit watched him with speculative eyes and spoke
in her usual impulsive fashion.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose for one moment that the
prince of Saskatoon is coming wooing my fair
sister? Because if he has any such notions at
all, I’d like to tell him she’s not for him,” she
said, emphatically. “Now I believe that I’m a
genius, but I have resources. I can do housework,
and be the castle maid of all work, and
smile and be a genius still, but Jean needs nourishing.
If he thinks for one moment he’s going
to throw her across his saddle bow and carry her
off to Saskatoon, he’s very much mistaken.”</p>

<p>Piney glanced up at the figures in the orchard,
before she answered in her slow, deliberate
fashion,</p>

<p>“I’m sure, I don’t know, but Ralph said he
was coming back here every spring, so he can’t
expect to take her away this year.”</p>

<p>Up in the orchard Mr. Robbins talked of
apple culture, of the comparative virtues of
Peck’s Pleasants and Shepherd Sweetings, and
whether peaches would grow in Gilead’s climate.
From the birch woods across the road there came
the clinking of a cow bell where Buttercup led
some young stock in search of good pasturage.
Shad was busy mending the cultivator that had
balked that morning, as he was weeding out the
rows of June peas. He called over to Mr.
Robbins for some advice, and the latter joined
him.</p>

<p>Ralph threw himself down in the grass beside
the little birch easel. Jean bent over her canvas,
touching in some shadows on the trunks of the
trees, absently. Her thoughts had wandered
from the old orchard, as they did so often these
days. It was the future that seemed more real
to her, with its hopes and ambitions, than the
present. Gilead was not one half so tangible as
Campodino perched on the Campagna hills with
the blue of the Mediterranean lapping at its feet.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you afraid you’ll miss it all?” asked
Ralph, suddenly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” she glanced down at him in Jean’s
own peculiar, impersonal way. To Ralph, she
had always been the little princess royal, ever
since he had first met her, that night a year ago,
in the spring gloaming. Dorrie and Kit had
met the stranger more than half way, and even
Helen, the fastidious, had liked him at first sight,
but with Jean, there had always been a certain
amount of reserve, her absorption in her work
always had hedged her around with thorns of
aloofness and apparent shyness. “But you see
after all, no matter how far one goes, one always
comes back, if there are those you love best waiting
for you.”</p>

<p>“You’ll only be gone three months, won’t
you?”</p>

<p>Jean shook her head.</p>

<p>“It depends on how I’m getting on. Cousin
Beth says I can find out in that time whether I
am just a plain barnyard chicken, or a real wild
swan. Did you ever hear of how the islanders
around Nantucket catch the young wild geese,
and clip their wings? They keep them then as
decoys, until there comes a day when the wings
are full grown again, and the geese escape.
Wouldn’t it be awful to imagine one were a captive
wild goose, and then try to fly and discover
you were just a nice little home bred White
Leghorn pullet.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jean,” called Kit. “Cousin Roxy’s going,
now.”</p>

<p>Ralph rose, and extended his hand.</p>

<p>“I hope your wings carry you far, Jean,” he
said earnestly. “We’re leaving for Saskatoon
Monday morning and I’ll hardly get over again
as Honey and I are doing all the packing and
crating, but you’ll see me again next spring,
won’t you?”</p>

<p>Jean laid her hand in his, frankly.</p>

<p>“Why, I didn’t know you were going so soon,”
she said. “Of course, I’ll see you if you come
back east.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come,” Ralph promised, and he stood
where she left him, under the blossoming apple
trees, watching the princess royal of Greenacres
join her family circle.</p>
